"Melania Trump, if her lawyers are correct, considered making many millions of dollars by turning her fame as first lady into lucrative ""broad-based commercial brand.""
In other words, she was going to monetize her proximity to power.
This is the argument put forward by her attorneys in a libel suit against the Daily Mail. During the 2016 campaign, the British tabloid published a story — outlandish, effectively unsourced, and denied by everyone contacted — suggesting Trump had been an escort.
Trump quickly promised to sue for defamation, and now she has. Her lawsuit in New York State court lays out a pretty solid case that the Daily Mail acted outrageously irresponsible in printing the rumors it probably suspected to be false. A lawsuit typically needs to allege not only that has someone acted wrongly, but that the action caused harm. The harm the first lady alleges is eye-catching.

Moore, 27, was carted off the course at Buttermilk Mountain in Aspen, Colo., before he was flown to Denver for surgery to repair the dislocation. 
He has been walking, according to a press release regarding fund-raising for Moore's recovery, but needs to go to a rehabilitation center for spinal cord injuries. 
The fund-raiser, which is posted on Road2Recovery, seeks to raise $175,000 for medical costs that Moore's insurance will not cover for him to recover at a private facility.

But the necessity of Pence's vote reflected another kind of history, too: The decision by all Senate Democrats to reject DeVos marked a new low for the flailing party. 
Democrats claim to stand for the poor, immigrants and nonwhites. Yet given a chance to actually support someone who is dedicated to improving education for all America's children, especially those trapped in failing urban schools, the Dems said no, hell no.

Trump again compared his wall to the one that Israel has, pointing out that they are very effective if done properly.
Last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaled his support for the wall, calling it a “great idea.”
“President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration,” he wrote on Twitter. "
"""CNN had a good day."" That's how Samantha Bee opened Wednesday's episode of ""Full Frontal."" 
Bee was referring to the 24-hour news channel's big day earlier this week when it granted President Donald Trump's senior adviser Kellyanne Conway time on the network after a brief ban. And it didn't turn out to be a good segment for her. 
Conway went on with Jake Tapper, who peppered her with everything from her Bowling Green massacre gaffe to making her admit that CNN isn't fake news. 
Or as Bee put it, Conway was thrown ""into Jake Tapper's cage, and they haven't fed him this week."" 
Then Bee gave props to CNN's debate later that evening between senators Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz on the fate of healthcare in the country.

"From journalists on the front lines to weekend hobbyists, from old-school wet process junkies to new-school digital wunderkinds, the umbrella of photographic practice is continually expanding. The very definition is an ongoing subject of conversation within photographic circles (particularly photography as a fine art practice). 
For many, a photograph is simply an image that captures an event/place/person as it occurred or looked in front of the lens. Even today, with an endless array of image-altering programs literally at our fingertips, there remains a degree of veracity associated with the photographic. 
We expect photographs to represent the truth, even though we accept that they can easily be doctored. In this sense, the appearance of ""truthiness"" becomes a sufficient replacement for actuality.

"Surely there are more than two Republican senators who are smart enough to realize that Betsy DeVos is simply underqualified and incompetent to lead the U.S. Department of Education. Which makes her confirmation Tuesday all the more maddening.
For all of President Trump's talk as a candidate about disrupting Washington as usual, there is nothing more politics-as-usual than this: elected officials who know better, who know they're doing a bad thing for the country, but who go ahead and do it anyway because they need a future relationship with a president who they probably also know is unsuited for his job, and because they fear incurring the wrath of GOP leaders if they cross the party line in the name of good governance.

During her hearings Sen. Bernie Sanders said, “There is a growing fear that ... we are moving toward what some would call an oligarchic society, where a small number of very wealthy billionaires control, to some degree, our economic and political life.”

"Less than three weeks after President Donald Trump took office, lawyers for his administration were in federal appeals court on Tuesday hoping to convince a panel of judges to reinstate an executive order excluding refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations from the country. 
The order imposing a de facto travel ban caused widespread chaos in the days after its implementation, and has been the target of dozens of lawsuits across the country. Last week, a federal judge in Seattle blocked the order's implementation nationwide . 
But the hearing at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, based in San Francisco, could be a bellwether for the order's legality ― as well as an important test for the limits of executive authority over immigration and the power of courts to check that authority.

Often, people in these regions are infected with several neglected tropical diseases ― not just one ― and may become disfigured or disabled as a result. Their conditions can prevent them from earning a living, keeping them locked in a cycle of poverty.

And because National Review was a major source of opposition to Trump it's also allegedly proof of our collective hypocrisy. I think most of that is silly, but I do have my objections to the piece.

“I was in shock,” she tells PEOPLE. “It was the breaking point. The Trump issue was the catalyst.”
It was the toughest decision Gayle, who is now living in her own apartment in Washington, says she has ever had to make.
“It took us many, many months to make this decision,” she says. “We went to counseling and saw a priest. This wasn't a snap decision.”

Tara Brown sensed she was in grave danger a week before Lionel Patea bashed her to death with the cover of a fire hydrant. 
Patea — who was yesterday sentenced to life in prison for murdering the mother of his child — had intimidated Ms Brown in the days leading up to the fatal attack on September 8, 2015, which occurred when he ran her vehicle off the road and bashed her on a Gold Coast street. 
The pair were in the Auckland airport on August 30, 2015, on their return to Australia after visiting New Zealand to scatter the ashes of Ms Brown's grandfather. 
Patea saw Ms Brown texting a friend, and in a fit of rage chased her through the airport before stealing her phone, Justice Debra Mullins said during her sentencing remarks. 
Another confrontation took place when they returned to Australia, with Patea fronting up to Ms Brown's home to tell her she was not to see their young daughter again. Photo: Tara Brown's attack was one of Queensland's highest-profile domestic violence"

"Gurmehar Kaur isn't anti-national just because her views differ from yours Thekedars of patriotism need introspection. 113 @sardesairajdeep A young woman spoke out against the politics of hate, on friendship with Pakistan, on seeking peace not war. Within minutes she was attacked by the soldiers of nationalism. How dare she challenge the dominant narrative of nationalism? Why should she shoot of the shoulders of a martyred father? Hey, why should a young woman be speaking at all, on political issues? Students, especially women, are supposed to study, stay silent and not have an opinion. Isn't that what our patriarchal culture is all about? So what if she wanted to express herself against the campus violence? She, like many others, is expected to simply hold her peace. And if she does choose to speak, then she must be lampooned, threatened, bullied into submission. I don't know Gurmehar Kaur .

But a provincial official said Tuesday's attack in Helmand province's capital Lashkar Gah could be an ""insider attack"" as one of the guards was still missing.
""An investigation is ongoing to find out if someone from inside has defected to the Taliban and paved the way for this crime,"" he said.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Al Jazeera the group was responsible for the attack, saying it killed 11 policemen and ""claimed the area and weapons"".
Din Mohammad, a doctor at the Lashkar Gah Hospital, confirmed the death toll.

Is “Logan” more powerful because of what the superhero genre has delivered over the last decade? Does it seem both groundbreaking and classic because it doesn’t feel like a modern superhero movie, especially those with the Marvel brand? Don’t worry. I’m not going to dissect the flaws of the Marvel and DC brands, but it’s undeniable that the modern superhero movie has relied on CGI, particularly in final acts comprised almost entirely of apocalyptic explosions. And so many of them have served as bridges between franchise entries that one feels like they’re constantly watching previews for the next movie instead of experiencing the one they’re watching. “Logan” has stakes that feel real, and fight choreography that’s fluid and gorgeous instead of just computer-generated effects. Most importantly, “Logan” has characters with which you identify and about whom you care. It's not just ""great for a superhero movie,"" it's a great movie for any genre.
