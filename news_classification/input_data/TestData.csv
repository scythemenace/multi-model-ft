"Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly said that the acrimony between the press and President Trump has grown into “war” that is helping neither side, nor the country. He made the comments in his opening statement Monday evening on his show.
“Critical mass has now been reached,” he began, “as the Trump administration is now denying access to certain news organizations it believes are out to get the president. So in an act of defiance, the president has announced he will not show up to this year’s White House Correspondence Dinner in April. He does however want everybody to have a good time.”
If this political controversy were a legal case, and I were the judge, I’d have to recuse myself. That’s because for the last 20 years I’ve watched the liberal media in America scorch the Fox News Channel and the media who work here, including me. The attacks are personal, relentless, and often dishonest.

SpaceX will fly two people to the moon next year - a feat not attempted since Nasa's Apollo heyday nearly 50 years ago. 
The pair, who know each other, have already paid a ""significant deposit"" to take the week-long trip. 
But their identities and exactly how much they have paid will not be publicly revealed, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said.

DALLAS (CBSDFW.COM) – Starting March 1, lighting up at parks or on trails in Dallas will be against the law. 
The total smoking ban was agreed up on by Dallas City Council members after months of debate. 
Assistant Director of Dallas Parks and Recreation, Oscar Carmona said that they won’t immediately crack down on people who violate the ban. Carmona said that they will give residents a month grace period to come into compliance. 
“We hope that people will go ahead and voluntarily comply with the rules but if the problems is persistent we will go ahead and take enforcement action,” he said.

And ahead of that bow, we’ve got a brand new behind-the-scenes clip in which costar Kristen Stewart discusses how their participation in the project was driven, first and foremost, by a desire to work with the Oscar-winning director. In the above behind-the-scenes featurette, Stewart confesses that she would have done almost any movie with Lee — which is why she signed on to Billy Lynn , even though she has a relatively small supporting part in the wartime drama. As she says, having to nail three scenes in four days is “one of the hardest things I’ve ever done,” although according to her director, she was more than up to the task — which was no surprise to him, given that she was always"

"February 23, 2017 Perhaps your teenager acts like showing up to school at 7:30 a.m. is a cruel and unusual punishment. Sleep research now shows he may be right. Teen biology creates a later sleep cycle for adolescents — they fall asleep later, which means they wake up later as well. Accordingly, a major education policy reform is staring education officials in the face, in the form of bleary-eyed students who would clearly benefit from different school hours. The formula is simple: A school bell that rings later could equal better academic performance. About 60 percent of high school students report extreme daytime sleepiness ; one study found that only 15 percent of adolescents get the recommended minimum of 8.5 hours of sleep on school nights. Extrapolate that to cover the roughly 300,000 high school students in the Commonwealth who start their school day at an average of 7:37 a.m., and it adds up to 255,000 sleep-deprived students.

"Jürgen Klopp has said he is responsible for Liverpool's mid-season nose dive and has warned that neither infighting nor “bathing in self-pity” will put the team back on course for Champions League qualification. 
The Liverpool manager dreams of winning the final 14 matches of the season - starting with Tottenham Hotspur's visit to Anfield on Saturday - but “knows how that sounds” following a demoralising run of one win in 10 matches. The team's rapid regression from Premier League title contention to fifth in the table, 13 points adrift of Chelsea, has invited widespread criticism with the lack of January signings, owners Fenway Sports Group and a perceived shortage of leaders on the pitch all under scrutiny. But Klopp, who tellingly said on Friday, “we are still convinced it is a long-term project”, insists the blame rests with him. 
“If it was that easy then open a market for leaders and we will buy all of them and then our problems are solved,” he said on the alleged lack of leaders"

"President Donald Trump's dark view of violent crime in America rests largely on a bogus claim: that the murder rate is higher than it's been in nearly half a century. Actually, the murder rate is down sharply in that time, despite a recent spike.
On Tuesday, he told a meeting of sheriffs: ""The murder rate in our country is the highest it's been in 47 years, right? Did you know that? Forty-seven years. I used to use that — I'd say that in a speech and everybody was surprised because the press doesn't tell it like it is."" He circled back to add: ""The murder rate is the highest it's been in, I guess, from 45 to 47 years.""
THE FACTS: The murder rate in 2015, the latest year for which figures are available, is actually among the lowest in half a century. It stood at 4.9 murders per 100,000 people, a far cry from the rates in the 1970s, 1980s and most of the 1990s, when they were typically over 6 per 100,000, peaking at over 10 in 1980.

"Who was Frederick Douglass? More importantly, why does Frederick Douglass matter to today's America? The above questions are not merely rhetorical, as the recent controversy surrounding President Trump's Black History Month statement illustrate. “Frederick Douglass,” Trump said , “is an example of somebody who's done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice.”
The mainstream media have caste Trump's curious mixture of both past and present tenses — “who's done” (past) vs. “is being recognized” (present) — as an incongruous construction at best, and at worst as clueless invocation of one of America's most beloved and revered historical figures. But there is certainly an alternative view to be had.
The alternative view is that whatever the President's intended form of language or actual prior knowledge Frederick Douglass, Douglass is certainly an example of excellence. Furthermore, especially during Black History Month, Douglass is receiving heightened recognition."

Net neutrality is the principle that internet service providers (ISPs) like Comcast ( CMCSA ) and AT&T ( T ) should not be able to charge more to pass along some kinds of data than others. It's an issue now that these companies own more than the “pipes”—they also own the companies that send video through them. For example, Comcast owns NBC, and AT&T owns DirecTV. Should Comcast be allowed to charge Netflix ( NFLX ) more because it's a rival?

The case triggered a period of national scrutiny for Coleman's family and an intense backlash around their town. Coleman became a pariah, a target on social media and in wide-open view: At a dance competition, someone brought a T-shirt declaring “Matt 1, Daisy 0.” 
“There were just so many people telling me what they thought I was,” Coleman, now a determined 19"
"You see it all the time in movies and TV shows: A security camera records footage of an intruder, but the image is too blurry or pixelated to make out who it is. 
Some nerdy-looking ""hacker"" then clacks at his keyboard and — boom — seconds later, pixelated image turns into a crisp one revealing the person's face in glorious detail. 
""Oh, come on!"" we all say while rolling our eyes. Well, you might have to break that habit because Google has figured out a way to turn movie magic into reality (sort of). 
According to ArsTechnica , researchers at Google's deep learning research project, Google Brain , have created software that attempts to ""sharpen"" images made up of 8 x 8 pixels. 
Of course, Google Brain's software can't actually enhance the original block of pixels. Instead, what it's doing is using machine learning to try to guess what the original image might be if it had been downsized to 64 pixels. 
Google Brain's software does this with two stages of neural network training. The"

The court ruled in November that Motsoeneng's appointment as group executive for corporate affairs - the post he held before becoming COO -- was ""irrational and unlawful"". 
It said Motsoeneng could not occupy any position at the SABC unless a 2014 report by the public protector was set aside or new disciplinary action against him was finalised.

"BERLIN Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) polled 31 percent in a survey on Wednesday, benefiting from a surge in support since nominating Martin Schulz as leader and narrowing the gap to Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives. 
The poll for Stern magazine and broadcaster RTL, published just over seven months before federal elections, was the first by the Forsa institute to give the SPD above 30 percent since October 2012. 
Merkel's conservative bloc, made up of her Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), lost 1 percentage point to 34 percent. 
The SPD gained 5 points from the previous Forsa survey. 
The poll showed as many Germans would vote for Schulz, who was previously European Parliament president, as for Merkel if there were a direct vote for chancellor, with both on 37 percent. 
The SPD, Merkel's junior coalition partner, has been trailing the conservatives for years in opinion polls and last won an election under Gerhard Schroe"

The finding might be useful for artists, sportspersons, and disabled people, researchers said. Rhythmic breathing is part of a number of international wellness practices such as yoga. ""We had two groups of young volunteers practise tracing a narrow path within two concentric circles on a tablet in two seconds,"" said Mutha. ""After the practice session, students in one group were made to do the breathing exercise for 30 minutes, while the students in the other group were asked to relax.""' When students were told to trace the lines again after the break, the researchers found that the group that did the breathing exercise performed strikingly better than the other group.

"Another round of bickering is boiling over about temperature readings used in a 2015 study to show how the planet is warming. 
The issue is about how readings gathered decades ago were adjusted to try to get a clearer picture of how the Earth's temperature is changing now. Those adjustments have been questioned by some who reject mainstream climate science and have tried to claim there has been a pause in global warming . 
A January study in a scientific journal used another set of measurements to confirm the readings and prove again that the earth's temperature is rising quickly and that the warming has not paused. 
But a congressional committee on Tuesday seized on complaints from a retired scientist from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration about how the original data were handled to claim the data were falsified—even though the retired NOAA scientist they cite does not argue that it was. 
What is being touted as a scientific scandal is more about data handling than"

"BEIJING The United States needs to brush up on its history about the South China Sea, as World War Two-related agreements mandated that all Chinese territories taken by Japan had to be returned to China, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in Australia. 
China has been upset by previous comments from the new U.S. administration about the disputed waterway. 
In his Senate confirmation hearing, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said China should not be allowed access to islands it has built there. The White House also vowed to defend ""international territories"" in the strategic waterway. 
However, last week U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis suggested that diplomacy should be the priority in the South China Sea.

The Japanese automaker and the Hitachi unit said Tuesday they will establish a joint venture in July to develop, produce and sell motors for electric vehicles and gasoline-electric hybrids. The new company will be based in Ibaraki Prefecture and capitalized at 5 billion yen ($44.5 million). Hitachi Automotive will take a 51% interest, while Honda will have 49%. 
Production facilities are to be built in the U.S. and China. The plan apparently involves selling products to major automakers such as Ford Motor and General Motors with the goal of cutting costs by pursuing economies of scale.
