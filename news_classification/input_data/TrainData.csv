Oscar Lopez Rivera, a convicted terrorist who was granted clemency by former President Obama, will have a street named after him in Chicago. 
Chicago’s city council recently voted to honor a 74-year-old former member of Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional (FALN), a Marxist Puerto Rican nationalist group with a history of violence. Mr. Rivera spent 35 years in prison after convictions related to 29 bombings and weapons charges, but that past did not sway enough city officials against the move. Nine alderman from 50 wards voted against the change.

"Sirius building's architect wants more inclusive Sydney as landmark opens to public By Mark Reddie Posted February 28, 2017 09:03:44 
One of Sydney's most prominent examples of brutalist architecture, the Sirius building at The Rocks, will be opened to the public for the first time in almost 40 years. 
The building was built in 1979 for public housing tenants displaced during redevelopment in the area. 
In 2014, the New South Wales Government announced it would sell the Cumberland Street block of 79 units , along with a swathe of heritage-listed terraces in nearby Millers Point. 
Most residents were moved out throughout 2015, despite their protests.

“At the end of the day we made a human error,” Ryan said. “We made a mistake. What happened was, our partner on the left side of the stage, Brian Cullinan, he handed the wrong envelope to Warren Beatty.

"Two sets of remarks, a day apart, by two men more accustomed to being behind the scenes.
Stephen K. Bannon , appearing Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, made the case for “economic nationalism” and called President Trump’s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership “one of the most pivotal moments in modern American history.” The passage of the Civil Rights Act and the defeat of the Soviet Union finally have some company.
As the ideologist in Trump’s inner circle, Bannon is a practitioner of Newt Gingrich’s mystic arts. Take some partially valid insight at the crossroads of pop economics, pop history and pop psychology; declare it an inexorable world-historic force; and, by implication, take credit for being the only one who sees the inner workings of reality.
For Bannon, it has something to do with “the fourth turning ,” or maybe the fifth progression, or the third cataclysm. At any rate, it apparently involves cycles of discontent and disruption. Lots of di"

Unlike the nominations, which rely on a branch-specific, preferential-voting system, winners are chosen by popular vote. Two accountants are tasked with bringing the final results, inside sealed envelopes, to the Oscars ceremony. They are the people carrying briefcases on the red carpet, flanked by police protection. Each briefcase contains an identical set of envelopes for the show's 24 categories. The accountants also memorize the winners.

"The Pittsburgh Steelers had one of the easier decisions among all teams when it came to using the franchise tag.
The Steelers focused their entire offense around running back Le’Veon Bell’s skills in the second half of last season, and rode him to the AFC championship game. The franchise tag for running backs isn’t too expensive, relatively speaking, and the Steelers didn’t wait until Wednesday’s deadline to slap the tag on him.
[ STACK: Why Cowboys legends want Zeke Elliott to stop hurdling defenders ]
Not only did Bell get the franchise tag, the Steelers gave him the exclusive tag, meaning he can’t negotiate with other teams. That news came from multiple outlets including NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport. The running back tag is about $12.4 million for one season.
Bell will presumably want a long-term deal, and the Steelers will have to figure out how to accommodate him. Bell is just 25 years old, is coming off a season in which he had 1,884 total yards in just 12 regular-season games, but"

President Donald Trump ’s budget proposal will include a $54 billion increase in military spending— nearly 10 percent —which is expected to be offset by cuts affecting most other government agencies. 
In a speech to the nation’s governors at the White House on Monday, Trump described the budget, which is weeks away from being introduced to Congress, as a “historical increase in defense spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States.” 
“We have to start winning wars again,” the president said. “When I was young, in high school and college, people used to say we never lost a war. We need to win or don’t fight it all. It’s a mess like you have never seen before.” 
During and after the 2016 campaign, Trump repeatedly referred to the U.S. military as “depleted” and a “disaster” that he will “rebuild.”

Mushrooms basically exhale carbon dioxide as they grow; you’re probably experiencing a little oxygen deprivation.”

Intellectual Ventures, cofounded by former Microsoft chief technology officer Nathan Myhrvold, believes that bleak outlook makes Florida’s entomological battlefield the perfect testing ground for an unusual and unproven approach to insect control. This summer the company plans to install a device that uses cameras and a laser beam to identify and shoot down psyllids on a U.S. Department of Agriculture site in the state. 
It will be the first real-world test of a device originally dreamed up as a way to control mosquitos that carry malaria in poor regions of the world—but that has been forced on a commercial diversion.

The video showed the child pushed off a parapet and lowered towards the surface of the water.

The seven-year-old boy appeared terrified and begged his father to stop.

The father then tested the child on arithmetics questions as he dangled above the water.

More than a dozen people surrounded the father and watched him question the child.

"A plan to force London minicab drivers to pass written English tests would put nearly a third of them out of business, the ride-hailing app Uber has argued.
In a high court battle with Transport for London , lawyers for Uber said the transport body’s own estimates suggest 33,000 drivers would either fail the test or be deterred from trying to renew their licence.
TfL, which licences nearly 118,000 minicab drivers, wants all applicants for a new, or renewed, private hire licence to pass the test by 31 September this year.
The test, which involves writing a short essay, would not apply to black cab drivers.
Uber said 33,000 drivers, around 28% of those who hold a licence at present, would lose their livelihood over three years.
Thomas de la Mare QC, for Uber, told the hearing on Tuesday that the requirement was “manifestly disproportionate” and would unfairly penalise drivers who had sufficient English to pass their driving test and read road signs but not to pass a written exam.

""These [diffuse axonal] injuries are quite unusual in cases of assault,"" State witness Dr Gavin Kirk testified.

"A British songwriter and composer filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court Monday against the Irish band U2, alleging it stole one of his songs for the 1991 album “Achtung Baby.”
Paul Rose, who now lives in New York, names lead singer Bono and bandmates The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. as well as Island Records in the suit.
A well-known musician in his own right — with 12 solo albums — Rose is seeking $5 million plus attorney fees, the suit said.

U2 has never given Rose a writer’s credit or acknowledged his role in creating the music — which became “The Fly,” the seventh song on “Achtung Baby” — the suit said.

President Trump frequently complains about Washington leaks. But what he is really concerned about is that these leaks are not random. He believes that they are being deployed to harm his administration. (Of course, he had no problem with WikiLeaks’ leak of e-mails from the Democratic National Committee during the campaign. “ I love WikiLeaks ,” he said.) But the pattern of leaks is uneven and, in one area, that inconsistent pattern may well redound to Trump’s advantage: Despite all the information that has come out of this leaky administration, his tax returns remain confidential (except for a single year leaked by one of Trump’s former wives). 
Among the leaks that have incensed the president is the New York Times report about phone records that showed members of Trump’s presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials before the election.

A pair of amateur metal detectors uncovered a spectacular collection of jewellery which is thought to be the oldest Iron Age gold hoard ever discovered in Britain. 
Friends Mark Hambleton and Joe Kania found the four torcs - three necklaces and one bracelet - buried close together on farmland in Staffordshire while on a day out just before Christmas. 
Experts believe the collection, which has been named the the Leekfrith Iron Age Torcs, is around 2,500 years old and features some of the earliest Celtic art ever discovered. 
It is not known why the items were buried, but it could have been for safekeeping, as an offering to the gods, or as an act of remembrance after their owner died.

JEFFERSON CITY • In order to devote the necessary time to all of the cases it’s responsible for, the state’s public defender office would need to hire an additional 333 attorneys. 
There are 349 currently on staff. 
The reasons that explain the need to nearly double that number aren’t new. They’re the same ones Michael Barrett, the state’s top public defender, has been sharing with lawmakers for years. 
He did so again during a budget hearing on Monday, describing overwhelmed attorneys backlogged with more than 100 cases, unable to spend enough time with their clients. 
Plus, he said, with a turnover rate fluctuating between 15 and 20 percent and a starting salary of $39,000, it’s often young, inexperienced lawyers, fresh out of law school, that are left to grapple with such an enormous workload.

Since 2004, developer Guerrilla Games has been chasing Halo . Tasked by Sony with producing a big-budget first-person shooter to compete with Microsoft’s flagship series, the studio has cranked out half a dozen visually striking but critically underwhelming Killzone games. The would-be Halo-killer sold respectably but never really dented Master Chief’s Spartan armor. The last entry, PS4 launch title Killzone: Shadow Fall, was a grim, nihilistic affair that hammered home the futility of the series’ nonstop war.

So it’s refreshing to see the Dutch studio give up the shooter arms race and trade in the grays and browns of Killzone for a colorful new property.

The video showed three dogs biting a small wild pig on its face and body for about two minutes before it was killed.

Jamie Vardy and Leicester are back with a bang. 
The striker scored a brilliant brace as the Foxes beat Liverpool 3-1 at the King Power. 
Vardy has looked a shadow of the player he was last year, and coming into tonight’s game was enduring a prolonged goal drought, but he finally put an end to it tonight, and scooped the Man of the Match performance. Shreeves grills Vardy 
Of course, the overriding narrative around this game was Claudio Ranieri’s sacking, and how the players would react. 
The fact that they suddenly came up with such a brilliant performance only confirms for many people that the players betrayed Ranieri and stabbed him in the back.

"Disney’s funny and relevant “Zootopia” won the Oscar for best animated feature at the 89th Academy Awards, held Sunday in Hollywood, California.
The box-office smash is the tale of a rabbit from the country and a big-city fox who team up to investigate a string of animal disappearances.
Judy Hopps is a rabbit who dreams of being an officer for Zootopia’s Police Department. The trouble is there’s never been a bunny cop.

Longshore’s work is a fierce paint-storm of bedazzled portraits of Frida Kahlo and Audrey Hepburn and cheeky sayings like “There’s No Crying At Bergdorf’s.” Ashley recently published her book You Don’t Look Fat, You Look Crazy, a fabulous bible of unfiltered advice that preaches hard work alongside personal mantras like “Always Ask For More” and “What Would Blue Ivy Do?” Ashley Longshore’s “You Don’t Look Fat, You Look Crazy” Photo: Paul Costello / Courtesy of Ashley Longshore Ashley’s glitzy artwork caught the eye of Blake Lively, who told us, “I noticed her gallery while driving down the street.

"I’ve got to admit, there’s always something that seems unTorontonian to me about people who hate streetcars. On some level, I can understand the arguments they are making — both emotional (they get in the way while I’m trying to drive!) or logical (one disabled streetcar backs up the whole line). But the rattling, rumbling, clanging, rail cars seem to me like so essential a part of the city that objecting to their presence here seems foreign — not bad, per se, but unfamiliar. As if they were pronouncing the second “t” in Toronto. I have the urge to ask, “Where you from?”
So that’s my bias — my childhood bedroom on Gerrard St. E. looked out onto a streetcar route, as did the apartment on Bathurst where I lived when I was first married. The Red Rocket has always been part of the look and sound of home to me and has for great periods of my life been the first and last leg of most trips I make around the city.

"A McMaster University medical researcher says the World Health Organization’s new “priority pathogens” list is a reminder that the world is “getting to the point where we have no useful antibiotics left.”
Lori Burrows told CTV News Channel that the misuse of antibiotics has caused so many bacteria to develop drug resistance that people are dying of formerly curable infections. 
Doctors have long known that bacteria can become drug-resistant when antibiotics are not used for a long enough period of time to completely wipe out an infection, allowing the most resistant to multiply. The fact that antibiotics are often prescribed for viral infections that antibiotics cannot cure only speeds up the process of drug-resistance.
No new class of antibiotics has come onto the market since the mid-1980s, according to a 2016 Roadmap for Antibiotic Discovery from Pew Charitable Trusts.
Burrows says doctors are trying to use the newer, more effective antibiotics as sparingly as possible but that has"

The exhibit “ Paris Refashioned ,” which opened February 10, weaves together ready-to-wear and couture garments made between 1957 and 1968 — a period when French design houses dominated the international fashion market.

"President Trump’s assertions about widespread voter fraud in the 2016 elections re-emerged this weekend, with a top Trump adviser saying Sunday the White House has provided “enormous evidence” to support claims while still producing no evidence.
“The White House has provided enormous evidence with respect to voter fraud, with respect to people being registered in more than one state,” White House policy adviser Stephen Miller told ABC’s “This Week,” amid calls for Trump to provide evidence for his claim.
Trump has argued since November that voter fraud cost him the popular vote, which he lost to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by several million ballots. However, the White House has yet to provide evidence, at least publicly, to support the argument.
“This morning, on this show, is not the venue for me to lay out all the evidence,” Miller said. “But I can tell you this: Voter fraud is a serious problem in this country.”

Following the news that the former general reportedly discussed U.S. sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December, then apparently misled his transition-team colleagues about it, the White House is giving the issue the silent treatment, Democratic lawmakers are asking for Flynn’s security clearance to be revoked, and tensions between Flynn and the intelligence community appear to be worsening.
On Thursday, the Washington Post and others reported that several U.S. officials with access to intercepted communications between Flynn and Kislyak had confirmed that Flynn had discussed the new election-related sanctions in December, possibly breaking the law. In that conversation, Flynn allegedly urged Russia to temper their response to the new sanctions, which were implemented by President Obama over Russia’s meddling in the U.S. presidential election.

None, however, produces as much teeth-gnashing as the 2006 Oscars, when Crash controversially edged out that year's overwhelming favorite, Brokeback Mountain .
There were several reasons why this particular upset was so, well, upsetting. For one, Crash — an ensemble drama written and directed by Paul Haggis about racial unrest in Los Angeles — was a love-it-or-hate-it proposition. Ta-Nehisi Coates fell into the hate-it camp; the essayist said of the film in 2009, ""If you're angry about race, but not particularly interested in understanding why, you probably like Crash .""

“There are a thousand ways to explain the Brexit vote, or the election of President Trump, or the strength in the polls in Holland of Geert Wilders or in France of Madame Le Pen and many other leaders in a nationalist, populist, or even fascist tradition of politics.”

"The flag of Montreal is getting a facelift to better represent the city’s indigenous origins.
Mayor Denis Coderre said it will take advantage of the city’s 375 th anniversary to modify the flag, creating a design that will recognize the city’s indigenous roots and contribution to its history.
Designed in 1939, the flag of Montreal is based on the city’s coat of arms, which was created in 1833. The goal at the time was to represent the city’s ‘founding people,’ but it omitted the fact that indigenous people occupied the land as far back as 4,000 years ago, and were displaced 185 years ago.
The current flag features the symbols of the so-called ‘founding people’: the fleur-de-lys for its French origins, the Rose of Lancaster for the English, the thistle for the Scots and the shamrock for the Irish.
The red cross in the centre is also meant to represent the fact that Ville-Marie was founded as a Catholic city.

Since the summer, Turkey has dismissed or suspended upwards of 100,000 from their jobs, including academics, civil servants and police officers, alleging ties to terror organizations.
Just days ago, police used tear gas to break up a protest at Ankara University in the Turkish capital denouncing the dismissal of 330 academics.
“The loss is that many of these academics who were expelled are extremely accomplished, well known scholars in their fields . . . which empties Turkish universities and drains an enormous amount of knowledge base and silences opposition and different opinions in Turkey,” said Feyzi Baban, a political science professor at Trent University, who attended the demonstration of about 20 people in downtown Toronto.

"The rapid rise in insecure work in the UK is costing the government almost £4bn a year in lost tax income and benefit payouts, according to new research into the gig economy by the Trades Union Congress.
The UK’s growing legions of low-paid, self-employed workers and those on zero-hours contracts earn significantly less than regular employees and therefore pay less tax and national insurance. Their relatively low earnings also make them more likely to need to rely on in-work benefits such as tax credits and housing benefit, the TUC said.
Taking those factors together translated to a loss to the exchequer of more than £75m a week – equivalent to more than a quarter of England’s social care budget.

"Environmental activists and local government officials warned more than a decade ago about the risk of catastrophic flooding below a major Northern California dam — the very scenario that threatened to unfold over the weekend, prompting evacuation orders for nearly 200,000 people.
State and federal regulators dismissed those fears at the time, saying they were confident the hillside that helps hold back hundreds of billions of gallons of water was stable and did not need to be reinforced with concrete. Story continues below
That decision has come under scrutiny now that the hillside — or emergency spillway, as officials call it — has been put to its first test in the Oroville Dam’s nearly 50-year history.
Over the weekend, water from the storm-swollen lake behind the dam spilled down the unpaved slope for 38 hours, eroding it enough that authorities feared a huge breach could open and send a 30-foot-high surge of water down the Feather River below, devastating thousands of homes.

Trudeau's team figured a meeting of two public figures must have wound up in a photo, somewhere: ""We looked for it,"" said the official. They eventually found it through Library and Archives Canada, a black-and-white image of the prime minister's dad sitting down, and Trump speaking from a podium.

And in November, they published their first series of co-written poems, in a chapbook called “Begotten,” which was published by Upper Rubber books.

"Wikipedia editors recently voted to ban the Daily Mail tabloid as a source for their website after deeming it “generally unreliable.” To put the severity of this decision in context, Wikipedia still allows references to Russia Today and Fox News, both of which display a clear bias toward the ruling parties of their respective countries.
It thus may seem like a remarkable decision for Wikipedia to ban the Daily Mail, but fake news stories by David Rose in two consecutive editions of the Mail on Sunday – which echoed throughout the international conservative media – provide perfect examples of why the decision was justified and wise.
On February 5 th , Rose ran a story alleging scandalous behavior by NOAA scientists in a 2015 paper. The story was based on an interview with retired NOAA scientist John Bates, who was not involved in the study. However, in follow-up interviews with real science journalists, Bates clarified that he was in no way disputing the quality or accuracy of the data,"

Deavin said the gang was well organised and operated like a professional outfit. “They were all wearing balaclavas and gloves and two of the men had been armed with Glocks. They were calm in how they instructed the couple to hand over money‚ guns and valuables‚” he said.

"Former George W. Bush speechwriter and current senor editor for The Atlantic David Frum joined Mediaite columnist John Ziegler on Ziegler’s podcast over the weekend to discuss the state of politics today. They touched on a number of subjects, such as how Donald Trump overtook the Republican Party, the role of the media in that “coup d’etat,” and how Fox News viewers tune in to be lied to.
Following a discussion about the dangers facing traditional democratic institutions in today’s political climate, the conversation shifted to the possibility that Trump has been compromised by Russia. Specifically, Ziegler noted that CNN recently reported that the intelligence community has corroborated much of of the infamous Trump/Russia dossier, leading more credibility to that document. In response, Frum wouldn’t say whether he agreed or not that the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin may have something on POTUS, but noted that Trump seems to be in lockstep with Russia when it comes to"
"About 300 students in Singapore will get the opportunity to work on tech problems faced by public agencies after the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) signed agreements with eight schools on Monday (Feb 13).
Agreements were signed with eight institutes of higher learning – the five polytechnics, the Institute of Technical Education, Singapore Institute of Technology and Singapore University of Technology and Design – to help students develop tech know-how by working on real-world challenges faced by public sector agencies.
Through these agreements, GovTech will provide students exposure through internships, attachments, final-year projects and tech-related competitions where they can gain hands-on experience.
For instance, potential projects with the Singapore University of Technology and Design include automated detection and execution of security measures to protect wireless networks from external attacks, GovTech said. An example of such attacks is the distributed"
"A shocking figure out of England shows that unexpected deaths among mental health patients have soared by nearly 50 percent in just three years. The term “unexpected deaths” can refer to suicide, misadventure, or neglect.
Luciana Berger, the country’s former shadow health minister, said she was “ashamed” to live in a country that allowed this to happen. From 2012-2013, 2,067 unexpected deaths were reported by the 33 mental health trusts that provided data; that figure had climbed to 3,160 by 2015-2016.
While serious funding cuts for mental health services over the past four years are shouldering some of the blame, this epidemic is also being seen in other countries, including the U.S. Psychiatry Professor David Healy points out that the common antidepressants known as SSRIs are responsible for a sobering 4,000 additional suicides every year in America and Europe, about 250 of which are in the U.K. In fact, he believes that a quarter of patients who take SSRIs end up feeling more anxious"

Before this incident, Cousins was issued his 17th technical foul this season after inadvertently catching Pelicans center Donatas Motiejunas in the face with an open-handed slap.
Cousins immediately went to the locker room to cool down after being given the foul.
The Kings' center is also now just one technical away from another NBA suspension after missing Wednesday's win over the Celtics due to league suspension over his 16th technical foul. He will earn a one-game suspension for every two technical fouls accrued the rest of this season.

" In 2003, Bruce Springsteen, Steven Van Zandt, Elvis Costello, and Dave Grohl made Grammys history. Backed by No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal and longtime Elvis Costello drummer Pete Thomas, the musicians united onstage to perform the Recording Academy awards gala’s first tribute. To honor Joe Strummer, the group ripped through The Clash’s “London Calling.” It was a performance to remember—and kicked off just one another tradition the Academy uses to honor artists who have died each year. Now, after a year during which seemingly countless major artists passed away, Vanity Fair spoke with Grammys executive producer Ken Ehrlich about how the Academy recognizes its late icons—both through tribute performances, and through its “In Memoriam” montage. To Ehrlich, the process is more art than science. Artists who receive individual tributes—this year, Prince and George Michael—tend to be those who had an exceptional level of influence on music during their lives. And although it’s important to"
"The show has barely started and many celebrities are already using the 2017 Grammy Awards as a political platform . As current events continue to challenge our country every day, many famous faces have joined in to advocate for those with lesser voices, and this year's Grammy celebration is most certainly the perfect setting for some of those issues to take center stage. In fact, producers of the annual ceremony actually encouraged artists to express their activism during their stage performances and presentations, producer Ken Ehrlich explained to Variety . “One of the tenets of our show is artistic freedom, and over the years we’ve shown we do believe in it” “How many more times do we need to hear ‘I’d like to thank my publicist, my agent, my wife and kids.’ The great acceptance speeches are ones that have a point of view and are more personal.”
As it turned out, there were many political moments at the 2017 Grammys , both on the red carpet and during the actual show. 1. Joy Villa "

At full-time it was Burnley who were left ruing missed chances and a point against the league leaders was the least they deserved.
Chelsea opened the scoring in the seventh minute after Victor Moses galloped into acres of space down the right flank and teed up Pedro to finish past Tom Heaton.
But Burnley equalised in the 24 th minute thanks to a brilliant left-footed free-kick from Robbie Brady on his full debut that left Thibaut Courtois grasping at thin air. Mesut Ozil suffering CRISIS of confidence, admits Arsenal boss Wenger

One show, stretching across what seemed like an endless amount of hours, brought us great joy – in the form of Beyoncé leaning backward in a chair and Bruno Mars strutting onstage in a purple suit – as well as a more than a few let-downs, mixed with some genuine confusion. No awards show, especially one honoring music, should have as many technical difficulties as we (and James Hetfield) had to endure Sunday night. And as much fun as James Corden is while he’s carpooling with the stars, his “who, me?” schtick struggled to fill a room as big as Staples Center.

The Lemonade album, for me, is so monumental.” Adele swept the night, winning in every category she was nominated for against Bey: Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Record of the Year, Best Pop Solo Performance (plus Best Pop Vocal Album, a category Bey wasn’t nominated in). But Lemonade was a gift for her as a woman and mother, and she noted its particular importance to black women. “You are our light,” she said. “The way you make me and my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel, is empowering. You make them stand up for themselves. I love you. I always have and I always will.”

He was charged with more than 20 counts of rape while working as a carer at the woman's Albany Creek home, north of Brisbane, last year.

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied Trump’s appeal to overturn a district court ruling that temporarily halts enforcement of certain parts of his executive order. It argued that , “The Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States.”

The Gascoyne River started flowing through the farming community of Carnarvon on Sunday, February 5 and reached a level on Friday that triggered the unrestricted pumping.
The declaration is for the remainder of February and is the first time growers have had unlimited access to the river in almost two years.
Banana grower Bruce Munro said many farmers had their pumps ready to go as soon as the declaration was issued.

"Film-maker Ken Loach has condemned the Government for closing down its child refugee programme as he won a BAFTA for his film I, Daniel Blake .
The director attacked last week’s announcement of the Government taking in just 350 displaced lone children who are fleeing war zones including Syria.
His film depicts a man from Newcastle struggling to cope with Britain’s welfare system, and has already won the prestigious Palme d’Or at Cannes.
Accepting the award for Outstanding British Film, the 80-year-old:
“The most vulnerable and poorest people are treated by this government with a callous brutality that is disgraceful.
“It’s a brutality that extends to keeping refugee children out that we promised to help. And that’s a disgrace too.
“Films can do many things - they can entertain, they can terrify, they can take us to other worlds, they can make us laugh and they can tell us something about the world we live in.

"In the last five years, North Korea has test fired more than 50 ballistic missiles in an effort to perfect a technology that its opponents fear might someday deliver a nuclear weapon.
So the launch of a missile on Sunday that soared 300 miles across North Korea, from west to east, before crashing harmlessly into the Sea of Japan, might have been another of those tests.
Or it could have been a test of President Trump .
The reclusive country's leader, Kim Jong Un , hasn't yet broadcast his country's motives for launching the missile — the first such test since before last year’s American presidential election. North Korea watchers suggested several possible reasons for the timing, both practical and geopolitical.
The regime has made missile technology — especially a long-range missile capable of reaching other continents — a national priority, and the test could have been a logical extension of that effort. The launch might also have been an attempt to discern how the Trump administration,"

Westbrook is averaging 31.2 points, 10.5 rebounds and 10.2 assists per contest over 34.8 minutes and has led the Thunder to a 31-24 record with virtually no supporting cast.
He’s leading the league in scoring and is looking to become the first player since Oscar Robertson in the 1961-1962 season to record a season-long triple-double.
Harden is putting up 29.1 points, 8.2 rebounds and is shockingly leading the NBA with 11.3 assists per game while leading the Rockets to a 40-17 record. His game has risen to a new level under the guidance of first-year Houston coach Mike D’Antoni.
As you might imagine, both players have sky-high usage rates. Westbrook’s 41.8 mark tops the NBA while Harden’s 34.3 mark ranks third. (DeMarcus Cousins ranks second in that regard)
In other words, both Westbrook and Harden are tasked with making their teams click on the offensive end and take on huge roles."

"I n an interview with Woman’s Own in 1987 , Margaret Thatcher said: “Too many … people have been given to understand, ‘I have a problem, it is the government’s job to cope with it.’” It’s a sentence that perfectly epitomises both the rise of neoliberalism – for which Thatcher can largely be thanked – and its death.
For there’s no doubt that neoliberalism – a system focused on free-market policies – is in decline after decades of dominance. As Aditya Chakrabortty argues in Guardian Opinion, we are witnessing its death .
George Monbiot similarly believes that neoliberalism is the ideology at the root of all our problems . But it is not only those you would expect to be critical of neoliberalism who are opposing it. Even organisations such as the International Monetary Fund, a champion of neoliberalism if ever there was one, openly question it too .
Unsurprisingly, it turns out that people do want government to deal with their problems – especially when it comes to issues of health, poverty,"

Addressing a cheering audience at a fundraising gala for the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT group, Streep referred to Trump’s tweet after her Globes speech, in which he called the celebrated actress “overrated.”
“Yes, I am the most overrated, over-decorated and currently, I am the most over-berated actress ... of my generation,” she said to laughs.

"A gentle service dog, facing euthanisation after being declared a ""dangerous animal"" for killing a Pomeranian, has walked free from an animal control centre in the US after a DNA test acquitted him.
Jeb, a two-year-old Belgian Malinois, was the service dog for Kenneth Job, 79, an Air Force veteran with neurodegenerative disease called Charcot-Marie-Tooth who uses Jed to help him stand and walk.
But Jeb's owners, Penny and Job, of St Clair, Michigan, knew there was no way their much-loved dog was a murderer, and were determined to have him exonerated.
So the family used a forensic technique often used for human defendants to save their dog from death row, CNN reported.
According to court testimony, on the morning of August 24, the Jobs' neighbour, Christopher Sawa, saw Jeb standing over the lifeless body of his Pomeranian dog, Vlad.
Sawa tried to give Vlad mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but it was too late. Sawa called animal control and blamed Jeb. Animal control took the big dog into custody."
"Tom Hayden’s death, in late October at the age of 76 , could not have been more untimely. The 60s protest leader missed by just three months the dawn of a new US mass movement , the likes of which we have not seen since Hayden led the charge against the Johnson and Nixon administrations’ relentless escalation of the Vietnam war.
If it’s any consolation, his sage voice lives on in a posthumously published book, Hell No: The Forgotten Power of the Vietnam Peace Movement . Indeed, for the same reasons that Hayden’s death was untimely, his book could not be more timely.

Believe it or not, my lovely country boasts the highest number and concentration of volcanoes in Europe.

This means that Italians are among the most exposed in the world to volcanic explosions . Remember what happened in Pompeii back in 79 A.D., when a catastrophic eruption buried thousands of fleeing villagers under a carpet of ash? Well a disaster like that could happen again — with even more dire consequences. “Italy lies in a very unfortunate spot: right at the intersection of the Eurasian and African plates that are constantly scraping against one another and boosting the underground trapped pressure,” explains Mario Sprovieri, an underwater geology researcher.

Mané raced onto a through ball, leaving Ben Davies in his dust before finishing confidently past Lloris. It immediately got worse for Spurs. Dier was caught in possession, leading to a quick snap shot for Lallana. Lloris stopped two efforts, but the second rebound fell to Mané who lashed home past two helpless defenders.

"Late last month, a pair of Islamic State fighters in desert camouflage climbed to the top of a river bluff in northern Iraq to demonstrate an important new weapon: a small drone, about six feet wide with swept wings and a small bomb tucked in its fuselage.

The aircraft glided over the besieged city of Mosul, swooped close to an Iraqi army outpost and dropped its bomb, scattering Iraqi troops with a small blast that left one figure sprawled on the ground, apparently dead or wounded. The incident was among dozens in recent weeks in a rapidly accelerating campaign of armed drone strikes by the Islamic State in northern Iraq.

"Listen A little over two years after a 42-unit affordable housing facility opened for Edmonton’s “hardest to house” indigenous civilians, a new report suggests it is succeeding in its goal of reducing hospital stays and calls for service. On Friday, Alberta Health Services released a report looking at the impact Ambrose Place – which opened in November 2014 – has had on the health of indigenous Edmontonians living there who previously hadn’t been successfully housed. WATCH: A look inside Ambrose Place AHS compared data on health care use for residents 24 months before moving to Ambrose Place and the 24 months after. However, AHS said because residents moved in at different times after the facility’s opening, their health service usage numbers were calculated per client. Among the report’s findings were that inpatient hospital admissions of Ambrose Place residents dropped by 58 per cent, an 81 per cent drop in the number of inpatient days in hospital, a 45 per cent drop in the number"

"The Second-Best Film of 2007... by Nuclear Pancakes! I nearly switched my choice for Best Picture from No Country For Old Men to Juno after watching it. It's a sweet film that is not only funny, but realistic. The acting is all great here. Michael Cera is always great and should get his reward sooner than later. Jason Bateman is perfect as the uneasy husband, and Jennifer Garner has done the best work of her career. Ellen Page is very good, but I felt she was a little overrated, but deserving of that Acadmy Award nod in every way -- and she had my vote. J.K. Simmons is probably the best in the film, arguably so. The writing is well done, and deserved the win. Though I think Diablo Cody should change her name, considering she's now a full-fledge writer and no longer works the pole. The film is funny and sweet and dramatic, but some of the jokes made me laugh out loud, and others had me staring and waiting for the story to continue. The music is great and fits the film perfectly. In my"

Scientists have discovered seven new planets the size of Earth that could have the potential of life outside of our planet. And considering what's happening on Earth right now, a lot of people are saying, well, it's about damn time. The new planets are about 40 light years from Earth , which is apparently not too far away when it comes to the solar system. They're orbiting a dwarf star called TRAPPIST-1, and the scientists who made the discovery say that not only are the size and mass of the planets similar to Earth, but they have ""equilibrium temperatures low enough to make possible the presence of liquid water on their surfaces ."" In-depth studies of the planets are likely on their way. Plans to begin making a new"

"02/21/2017 09:47 am ET Targeting Gut Bacteria May Be The Key To Preventing Alzheimer's Diet could be a powerful mode of prevention, according to a study that supports previous research findings. By Carolyn Gregoire Nomadsoul1 via Getty Images A new study suggests that a gut-healthy diet may play a powerful role in preventing one of the most feared diseases in America. Mounting research continues to show the links between the health of the gut and that of the brain. Now, a new study from Lund University in Sweden finds that unhealthy intestinal flora can accelerate the development of Alzheimer’s disease. The report, published Feb. 8 in the journal Scientific Reports , demonstrates that mice with Alzheimer’s have a different gut bacterial profile than those that do not have the disease. The gut microbiome is highly responsive to dietary and lifestyle factors . This suggests that a gut-healthy diet may play a powerful role in preventing one of the most feared diseases in America."
