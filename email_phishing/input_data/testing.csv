Poise Confidence 1 No problem here. Suzette is quite confident without being cocky. Leadership Potential 1 It is very easy to imagine Suzette in a leadership role. Personality Enthusiasm 1 Very energetic and ascited about the possibility of being a Texas MBA student. Maturity 2 She should not have any problem mixing with older, more-experienced students. Clarity of Professional Focus 2 Seems very focused on the potential opportunities following receiving an MBA degree, but is still open-minded. Please provide the Admission Committee with a brief narrative overview of your AdmissionVisit dialogue. You may use this opportunity to elaborate further on the above rankings. We had a very comfortable and open exchange of information regarding her work experience and views on current business topics. She is well-seasoned in dealing with complex business issues and would very likely be ahead of many of her fellow students. She exudes confidence yet remains open to new ideas and ways of thinking. I have no reservation in saying that Suzette would flourish at UT and contribute significantly to the overall quality of the class. Do you believe this candidate is a good match for the culture and strengths of the TEXASMBA program? Please elaborate on any reservations you may have. Suzette is definitely a good match for the Texas MBA program. She is a high energy, very results-oriented individual with a tremendous track record of successful accomplishments. Her personality is very conducive to working in a diverse team environment and I see no issue that would prevent her from being a top-notch MBA student at UT. "

It turns out this formula needed some serious u= pgrading when research showed the values in the formula were much too low.= The old wind chill did the public a disservice by convincing people they could safely endure extreme cold. More often, it scared people into stayin= g indoors when they could safely go out, and it prompted unnecessary schoo= l and business closings. Specifically, the old wind chill was too cold si= nce it was based on wind measurements at 33 feet (the official height for= wind observations), which can be 3 times as strong as the wind at the sur= face. In 1945, Antarctic explorers Siple and Passel developed the first wi= nd chill index by measuring the heat loss from a container of water as it froze while suspended from the 33-foot pole. When the old formula was dev= eloped, the technology did not exist to verify the accuracy those index va= lues. The new formula, implemented Nov 1, 2001, uses winds measured at 5= feet, which is much more representative of the wind that a human body exp= eriences. The new Wind Chill/Temperature Index also makes use of advances in meteorology, biometeorology and computer modeling to provide a more acc= urate, useful formula for calculating the dangers from winter winds and f= reezing temperatures. In addition, clinical trials have been conducted and= the results of those trials have been used to verify and improve the accu= racy of the new formula.

Hyperion Solutions, a maker of client server software also posted better than expected earnings. The NASDAQ closed higher on Wednesday but fell short of testing the 25% retracement level of the rally off last September's low, which crosses at 1930.89. This leaves the door open for additional weakness with the 38% retracement level crossing at 1826.96 later this winter. The NASDAQ closed up 39.85 points at 1922.38. The March S&P 500 index also closed higher on Wednesday as it consolidated above the 25% retracement level of the rally off September's low crossing at 1122.57. Multiple closes above last week's high at 1150 will be needed to temper the near-term bearish outlook in the market. The March S&P 500 closed up 7.70 points at 1129. The Dow closed slightly higher on Wednesday amidst support from on-target earnings reports from Boeing, Caterpillar, Merrill Lynch and Pfizer. Slightly better than expected earnings figures came from Exxon Mobil. The Dow managed to closes just above key fib support crossing at 9706.20. Closes above minor resistance crossing at 9857.70 would help temper the near-term bearish outlook in the market. Short- term momentum indicators are bearish but becoming oversold hinting that at the very least we could see a short covering bounce possibly into the end of January. INTEREST RATES <URL> March T-bonds closed sharply lower on Wednesday thereby confirming last week's breakout below January's uptrend line. Much of today's pressure was due to a rebound in the equity markets and uncertainty over Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments on Thursday regarding the economy. Stochastics and the RSI have turned bearish from overbought conditions with today's sell off and signal that additional weakness is possible into the end of January. If the decline continues, the December-January uptrend line crossing near 100-20 is March's next target. The CRB INDEX <URL> The CRB index posted a quiet inside day with a slightly higher close on Wednesday due to light short covering triggered by strength in some livestock markets, some foods and energies. The CRB is pausing around the 50% retracement level of the October-January rally crossing at 189.40. If this decline continues, the 62% retracement level crossing at 187.85 is the CRB's next target. ENERGY MARKETS <URL> The energy markets closed higher on Wednesday with the exception of natural gas, which posted a new contract low. Contract rolling from February to the March contract along with continued technical short covering off last week's lows continues to underpin this week's rebounds in crude oil and the products. The reaction to this afternoon's inventory report will speak volumes about the underlying tone of the markets. If prices continue to rebound following a bearish report it would indicate that the bearish news has already been factored into prices. March crude oil closed higher on Wednesday and above January's downtrend line thereby hinting that a short-term bottom might be in place. Closes above last fall's broken uptrend line crossing near 20.00 are needed before a bottom is confirmed. Stochastics and the RSI are oversold but turning neutral to bullish with this week's rebound hinting that a low is in or near. March heating oil closed higher on Wednesday but remains locked in last week's trading range. Closes above 54.70 or below 51.20 are needed to confirm a breakout of this trading range and point the direction of the next minor trending move. Momentum indicators are bearish but oversold while trend-following indicators are in position to confirm a trading range breakout. This afternoon's API inventory report might provide the catalyst needed for a trend change. March unleaded gas closed higher on Wednesday thereby confirming the recent breakout above January's downtrend line. Today's rally turned a number of momentum indicators neutral to bullish hinting that a low is in or near following last week's test of last fall's uptrend line crossing near 55.10. Closes below this uptrend line would open the door for a test of last fall's lows beginning at 53.00 and extending down to 51.90. March Henry Hub natural gas closed into new contract lows on Wednesday pressured by this week's AGA inventory report, which showed a draw in stocks of 124 billion cubic feet, which was termed bearish by traders. US storage is estimated at 73% full. This week's breakout into new contract lows has set the stage for a possible test of weekly support crossing at 1.76 later this winter. CURRENCIES <URL> The March Dollar posted a key reversal up on Wednesday and spiked above December's high before light profit taking ahead of the close tempered some of today's gains. Closes above today's high would confirm a breakout into new contract highs while opening the door for a possible test of weekly resistance crossing at 120.11 later this winter. Stochastics and the RSI remain bullish signaling that additional gains are possible if March can close above December's high crossing at 118.85. Support begins at last Friday's low crossing at 117.85. The March Swiss Franc closed sharply lower on Wednesday and is once again poised to test the lower boundary of last fall's trading range support crossing at .5973. Multiple closes below this support level or above neckline resistance crossing near .6067 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market. Stochastics and the RSI remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into the end of January. The March Canadian Dollar closed higher on Wednesday thereby confirming yesterday's key reversal up. Today's close above broken support crossing at .6230 tempers the near-term bearish outlook in the market. However, I would not be surprised to see a setback on Thursday as March might try to consolidate some of this week's gains. Momentum indicators are diverging and turning bullish with this week's rebound hinting that a low is in or near. The March Japanese Yen posted a new contract low on Wednesday thereby confirming yesterday's breakout below key weekly support crossing at .7558. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness is likely. If the decline continues, weekly support crossing at .7371 is March's next likely target. PRECIOUS METALS <URL> February gold closed sharply lower on Wednesday and below December's uptrend line thereby confirming a top and trend change has taken place. Session lows tested the 62% retracement level of the December-January rally crossing at 278.70. While a pause is possible near-term level, the door remains open for additional weakness with fib support crossing at 276 being February's next target. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible near-term. March silver closed lower on Wednesday as it extended its breakout below the 62% retracement level of November's rally crossing at 4.327. The door remains open for a test of the next level of fib support crossing at 4.221 later this month. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible during the last half of January. March copper closed higher due to technical short covering for the second day in a row on Wednesday. However, closes above last week's high crossing at 71.40 are needed to temper the near-term bearish outlook in the market. Closes above 72.40 are needed to renew March's rally off this month's low. Momentum indicators are neutral as they wait for a breakout of January's trading range. GRAINS <URL> March corn gapped down and closed sharply lower on Wednesday due to renewed fund selling amidst rising prospects for showers in South America's key corn growing regions later this week. Additional pressure came from reports of recent wheat sales by Argentina, which will provide increased competition for U.S. corn in the world market. Bearish traders continue to point to sluggish U.S. corn exports, which are running some 9% below year ago levels and are willing to overlook tighter ending stocks for this year. March spiked to new contract lows during the session but failed to uncover fresh sell stops below the previous contract low, which then triggered a short covering rebound. Light support came from a higher close in wheat and expectations for a strong export sales report on Friday. Closes below today's low would confirm a breakout below this winter's trading range thereby opening the door for a possible test of weekly support crossing at 2.04 1/4 later this winter. March wheat posted a key reversal up on Wednesday amidst technical short covering. Today's rally managed to fill Tuesday's gap at 2.97 1/2, which is slightly positive from a technical standpoint. However, March remains vulnerable to test December's uptrend line crossing near 2.93 possibly on Thursday. Closes below this support level would open the door for a larger-degree decline into the end of January. Renewed selling by Argentina after being out of the market since late-December limited today's gains and will act as a weight on the market near-term. Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are likely into the end of January. SOYBEAN COMPLEX <URL> March soybeans plunged below gap support crossing at 4.37 amidst increased chances for precip across the dryer regions of South America by the weekend. Additional pressure came from today's sharp sell off in soybean meal. While a short covering bounce is possible on Thursday, the stage is set for a likely test of the early-January gap beginning at 4.28 1/2 and extending down to 4.26 3/4. Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible near-term. I would not rule out a test if not spike to new contract lows later this winter following the sharp decline off last week's high. March soybean meal closed sharply lower on Wednesday filling the gap crossing at 154.80 and is now poised to test the gap crossing at 150.30 possibly on Thursday. News that meal tightness in Europe is only temporary along with increased chances for precip across South America continues to pressure the market. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness into the end of January is likely. LIVESTOCK <URL> April hogs closed modestly higher on Wednesday due to technical short covering following a test of the 25% retracement level of the rally off last fall's low. The mid- range close leaves the door open for a steady opening on Thursday, as the market will continue to look to the cash and product markets for near-term direction. April continues to hold a stiff premium to the cash market, which will continue to limit upside potential near-term. Closes below Wednesday's low at 59.32 would confirm this week's trendline breakout while opening the door for a larger-degree decline into early-February. April cattle closed higher on Wednesday, as bulls are not going to give up control of the market without a fight. Today's short covering bounce was triggered by rising hopes for higher cash and boxed beef values later this week. However April closed below the 50% retracement level of last year's decline crossing at 71.36. Momentum indicators are diverging and have turned neutral to bearish hinting that a short-term top might be in or is near. However, closes below initial trendline support crossing near 70.87 are needed before a short-term top can be confirmed. FOOD FIBER <URL> March coffee closed slightly lower on Wednesday. Early weakness was due to small speculator selling however, industry and trade buying tempered early losses as the market tried to catch its breath today following the sharp decline off last week's high. However, near ideal growing conditions in Brazil's coffee region continue to keep expectations for a record coffee crop high on trader's minds thereby limiting near-term upside potential. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are likely into the end of January. This sets the stage for a possible test of this winter's low crossing at 44.75 later this month. March cocoa closed higher on Wednesday and filled the gap crossing at 1355 thereby tempering the bearish outlook in the market. Today's rebound confirmed Tuesday's key reversal up while turning a number of short-term momentum indicators neutral to bullish. This sets the stage for sideways to higher prices into the end of January. However, March will need to close above 1422 or below 1260 to confirm a breakout of this winter's trading range and clear up near-term direction in the market. March sugar posted an inside day with a lower close on Wednesday and is poised to test last fall's uptrend line crossing near 721. Closes below this support level would open the door for a likely test of December's low crossing at 690 later this winter. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are still possible into the end of January. March cotton closed lower on Wednesday however, a short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today's losses. The high-range close leaves the door open for a possible short covering bounce on Thursday. However, upside potential appears limited given the large net long position held by speculators. This leaves the market vulnerable to additional long-liquidation into the end of the month if export sales begin to taper off from recent levels. Stochastics and the RSI have turned bearish with the sell off from last Friday's high warning traders that a test of trading range support crossing near 34.91 is possible later this winter.

showard@agsk.com,"I would like to send the following e-mail to Oaktree's lawyer. What do you think? I would like to send the following e-mail to Oaktree's lawyer. What do you think? My points are not directly responsive to the prior e-mail, but I think this gives us a hook to assert a position that you and I have discussed but never actually asserted. Steve Bruce, I am a little late answering your attached e-mail. Brian Barth met with Mike Swartz in the first half of 2000 in his capacity as counsel for Oaktree and in the context of Oaktree's written agreement, and Mike's oral agreement, that Oaktree's counsel would not disclose to, or use for, Farallon anything learned from Barth in the meeting (which meeting Oaktree insisted take place pursuant to the parties' written agreement.) In direct violation of the written and oral agreements, Shawna Ballard thereafter disclosed the Barth/Swartz meeting on the public record in Barth's deposition and began asserting statements in the deposition that Brian had allegedly made to Mike. (Shawna's factual assertions about what Brian said were in fact wrong, but that is beside the point.) Until Shawna made her disclosures, none of the defendants was even aware that the meeting had taken place. Now, as a result of Shawna's disclosures, in a variety of ways the other defendants have initiated formal and informal discovery against Enron and are otherwise taking positions adverse to Enron. Enron intends to hold Oaktree responsible for all damages arising out of its breach of its written agreement with Enron, including Enron's substantially increased attorneys fees in the various litigations. ""MacLeodB@hbdlawyers.com"" 04/04/01 03:18PM Steve I am having a little trouble understanding the complaints stated in your two e-mails repeated below. With regard to the Barth deposition, Section 2.01 of the parties' cooperation agreement expressly authorizes Oaktree to reveal information obtained from ECT to potential witnesses or even as exhibits in depositions. With regard to our document production, Section 2.01 again specifically authorizes us to provide documents or information obtained from ECT in responding to discovery requests. Moreover, we know of no know proper privilege objection that would have allowed us to withhold any of the materials we have produced in response to NatWest's subpoena. Our production in response to NatWest's subpoena is substantially complete. If, after you have reviewed that production, you continue to believe that we are in error with regard to the Oaktree/ECT agreement or the proper scope of our production, give me a call and we discuss it. Thanks Steve. To: MacLeodB@hbdlawyers.com "

tim.belden@enron.com,"Mandatory Planning Meeting Training Sessions Please plan on attending a meeting on Wednesday January 2nd at 11 AM in Mt. Hood. During the first two weeks of January we would like to hold training sessions for people in our office. The goal is to provide an overview of each major function in our office to anyone who is interested in learning about what goes on here. My current thinking is to spend an hour each day, say from 11 AM until noon, in training. One or more people from each group will be responsible for coming up with an outline/agenda and leading an hour long session on what you do. If you have received this e-mail, you have been tentatively nominated by me to lead or co-lead one of the training sessions. Here are the sessions that I propose: Overview Tim Belden and/or Chris Calger Risk John Postlethwaite Scheduling Stacey Runswick, Donald Robinson, Diane Cutsforth Fundamentals Tim Heizenrader Real Time Bill Williams Term Trading Matt Motley Cash Trading Sean Crandall California Market Jeff Richter Middle Market Stewart Rosman and Paul Choi Services Chris Foster Credit Susan Rance RTO Development Alan Comnes Legal Christian Yoder BPA Steve Hall Here are some ideas to consider for presentations: What does your job entail important timelines and workflow during the day.

valarie.sabo@enron.com,"trading day 11/12 We were again delayed by the cali market information inaccuracies. The corrections are still not made because of mass confusion with the iso. I chose to run the P&L and take reserves against the estimated revenue because we have discovered that our purchased schedules were actually cut by the px and iso. And we did not know the schedules were cut as the control areas (BPA, LA, ISO) did not inform us, so we did not resupply our firm sales which might leave us open to Liquidated damages, once the control areas provide final flows to the utilities. We have begun a task force that includes risk, vol mang, real time, and traders so that we can enumerate the schedules and their values. Also, if we had been able to publish at noon, our VAR numbers were not available, and at this time (12:30 houston) are still not available."
christi.nicolay@enron.com,"No. 1 (a) We need to clarify what ""arrange"" means. For example, who is responsible for paying for Point to Point service (which would probably be needed in order to import/export power from Entergy or when sourcing/selling to a non-designated resource.) Also, there is a huge risk that PTP (or the ability to add a network resource) will not be available at the time when importing/exporting power is most economical. EPMI can reserve/schedule on behalf of Clarksdale, but will Clarksdale be paying for the extra transmission service? (b) Entergy's policies allow for a day ahead designation of network resources, if transmission is available. However, this designation is not as firm as the network service that Clarksdale will be purchasing when requesting its original network. It seems that we can state that we will not impact Clarksdale's original network resource designation; however, when using an alternate designation, there is the possibility that the transmission could be cut before the rest of firm. We can agree to this, but lose flexibility. I agree that we would then need the local quick start generation in order to meet this request (however, such plant may not be available either.) No. 6 Both of the above tie into this one (as well as the ""profit"" calculation in No. 3) how is the ""goal"" of minimizing the resulting net power supply costs measured? EPMI will probably not be totally successful in having a cost reduction 100% of the time, especially if we try to use non-firm transmission at times because generally that imported/exported power cost can be to their advantage. Since the Cities will have final approval, they may want to take some risk and use non-firm: understanding that sometimes it won't work and the plant may have to run. This wording also needs to be clarified as to ""arrange"" for example, ""reserve transmission on behalf of Clarksdale""; ""schedule transactions via etag on behalf of Clarksdale.""
