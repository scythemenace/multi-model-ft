katherine.kelly@enron.com,"All, I just wanted to give you a heads up on this, since it will in the future have an impact on your groups. We are in the process of working with IT to develop several enhancements to unify that will enable us to at first obtain the reports to more accurately book various types of deals such as storage and agency deals. The second phase will be to automate unify so that the recording of the deals can move directly from unify to SAP. The end goal is to have unify and the GL as close as possible mirror what is in sitara and the P&L, thus minimizing UAF and OA exposure. One of the items that is to be addressed during these enhancements is to have the desk associated with each of the deals in unify. This will allow us to split pipelines across desks for end reporting uses just as we do in the P&L. We are also hoping to move to a process where we will be settling on all of our desk to desk deals through the actualization process which will reduce the UAF exposure. How this will impact your groups is that once we move to this phase, we will need to have all desk to desk deals be assigned a meter and pathed as a buy/sell so that these deals will flow into unify. I know that this will cause additional work on your end, so I wanted to give you at least some forewarning that this topic would be coming up over the next few months and as much preparation time as possible. Please feel free to let me know of any concerns or ideas that you might have. As I said before, we are only just now beginning talks with IT to develop these enhancements, so I would foresee that this will not be an issue for a month or two. Thanks for all your help! Kathy",1

brown_mary_jo@lilly.com,"Lilly Press Release - 2 - Lilly and Generex Sign Agreement To Develop Buccal Form of Insulin Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Generex Biotechnology Corporation (NASDAQ: GNBT) today announced that they have signed an agreement to develop a buccal formulation of insulin that is administered as a fine spray into the oral cavity using Generex proprietary technology. Under the terms of the agreement, Generex will receive certain initial fees and milestone payments. Generex will also receive royalty payments based on product sales. In exchange, Lilly will receive exclusive worldwide rights to products resulting from the collaboration. Lilly will be responsible for conducting clinical trials, securing regulatory approvals and marketing on a worldwide basis. Clinical trials of the first product candidate are under way in North America and Europe. Lilly will also have the option to develop a number of additional products depending on the success of the initial product. ""We look forward to working with Generex, whose buccal spray delivery technology potentially represents a novel approach to drug delivery,"" said James A. Harper, president, diabetes and growth disorders products for Lilly. ""A buccal spray formulation of insulin could provide an attractive alternative for people with diabetes."" ""The opportunity to partner with Lilly, the global leader in insulins, to develop the world's first marketed buccal insulin spray represents very good news for millions of patients with diabetes throughout the world,"" said Anna Gluskin, chief executive officer of Generex. ""We are pleased that Lilly has recognized the potential of buccal delivery of insulin and Generex's RapidMist? technology for systemic delivery of proteins, peptides and other large molecule drugs."" Today, worldwide costs for treating diabetes and its complications are estimated to exceed $200 billion annually. It is also estimated that, over the next decade, the number of people with this disease will more than double. Lilly has been a leader in diabetes care for more than 75 years. The company continues to aggressively pursue the goal of being a complete diabetes care company and intends to provide innovative products to treat all types and stages of diabetes. Generex is engaged in the research and development of drug delivery systems and technologies. To date, it has focused on developing a platform technology for the buccal delivery (absorption through the inner cheek walls) of large molecule drugs which, historically, have been administered only by injection. Additional information about Generex can be found at <URL> Lilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing portfolio of best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest research from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with eminent scientific organizations.

To answer your second question, the basis curve ""NGI PGE/TOPOCK"" is not a basis point that we currently have any positions in. From what I gathered if we do make a position it would be more likely to be at PGE-City gate (NGI PGE/CG).

astorey@nyiso.com,"Virtual Bidding (VB) Seminar Friday November 30 AStorey@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List: We'll be running the third training session on Virtual Bidding on Friday, November 30. This course is valuable to everyone involved in our energy markets not just to those bidding ""virtually"". We fully booked our previous two sessions, and this will probably be our last VB program this year. Therefore, if you haven't attended so far, we suggest you give this serious consideration. The program covers: NYISO Bidding Fundamentals an optional overview of the NYISO marketplace Virtual Transaction basics Virtual Transaction charges Virtual Transaction bid entry billing Credit requirements Illustrations and examples Market Monitoring functions involving Virtual Transactions We start the program with an optional 75-minute Introduction to the NYISO and LBMP. This opener provides some basics on power systems and how we operate the New York electric marketplace. If you're new to the electric business, or at least to New York's market, we think you'll find it very useful. On the other hand, if you're familiar with our operation (other than virtual bidding), you probably don't need the introductory. It's an option intended to help newcomers get up to speed for the rest of the program, which focuses on Virtual Bidding topics. Our registration desk will open at 8:00am and remain open all morning. The introductory starts at 8:30 am. If you don't want the introductory, just show up for the Virtual Bid portions, which will starts at 10:00 am. The program will be conducted at the Desmond Hotel, 660 Albany-Shaker Road, Albany, New York. Register for the seminar through our web site at: <URL> Details are included there. Hope you can make it on the 30th to discuss this exciting new aspect of the two settlement system. ",1

These inquiries had been driven primarily, but not exclusively, by the GTN open season for additional capacity into the Pacific Northwest, and California. As part of the feasibility assessment, customers with contracted capacity expiring beyond November 1, 2002 who wished to turn back capacity were asked to inform us of their requests. This would form part of a capacity rationalization process. Customers currently holding one year re-newable contracts were asked to inform us of their plans to turn back capacity after November 1, 2002. As well, all existing customers were asked to provide information concerning their plans to extend their contracts beyond the current expiry date as well as their estimate of any additional firm service requirements they may have, in excess of their firm contracts, on our west-path systems. This solicitation was also communicated to other parties. This information was to be provided to TransCanada by March 12, 2001. Based on these solicitations, TransCanada has received significant incremental queuing requests in both the NGTL and B.C. System queue. Upon receiving signed contracts, TransCanada plans to seek regulatory approval to expand our Alberta System by up to approximately 227mmcf/d of incremental capacity and expand our B.C. System by up to approximately 216 mmcf/d of incremental capacity. We are currently tendering precedent agreements for ABC Border and B.C. system capacity to expansion shippers, based on queue priority. These customers will have until April 2, 2001 to return these agreements. Once TransCanada has received these executed agreements, we will proceed with the appropriate processes, including regulatory approval, to ensure an on stream date of November 1, 2002. If you have any questions or require additional information, please contact Don Bell at [403] 920.5560, don_bell@transcanada.com. ",1

""The key to our success was the ease-of-use of the voting system. Our members found the voting application to be intuitive and convenient. Taking our election online allowed our members to view candidate profiles and vote in just a few minutes."" Votenet's eBallot software provides: Convenient 24 hour a day online ballots integrated into the organization's website; Candidate biographies; Election management suite that enables election administrators to monitor voting and view real-time voting reports; Login security ensures one vote per eligible voter; Web-based application is scalable to handle any size election or referendum.

Now to be able to perform that function, while also offering candidate biographies, a 'voting wizard' to aid voters, and real-time results, online is impressive.

DPC is likely to make a similar presentation to its secured= creditors like the Japanese and Belgian Exim banks on June 5 and June 6, a= nd other foreign banks on June 7, in meetings scheduled to be held in Singa= pore. FI sources said DPC is now willing to bring down the internal rate of= return from the existing rate which is more than 30 per cent as well as th= e dollar return of equity. All these will hinge around a reduction in tarif= fs, as demanded by MSEB and the state and central governments. The domestic= lenders to the controversial project have agreed to consider a reduction i= n rate of interest.=20 They have, however, shot down a proposal regarding delaying the phase II co= nstruction till the first delivery of LNG starts by 2001-end. If these prop= osals become a workable proposition for all the concerned parties, lenders may have to start disburse loans for the second phase of the project, that was withheld following the payment dispute. As part of the proposals, DPC h= as demanded that the lenders allow it to complete the project with some tim= e and cost overrun. ""Though the exact cost overrun is yet to be calculated,= a rough calculation has put the figure at around $400 m,"" said FI sources.= DPC is believed to be now optimistic about completion of the project with the help of lenders and with various adjustments that are yet to be agreed upon by concerned parties. FI sources said some foreign developmental finan= cial institutions have already supported DPC's proposals to continue with the project. The lenders said there was no discussion over transfer of asse= ts either to the electricity board or any special purpose vehicle. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= BUSINESS STANDARD, Friday, June 01, 2001 DPC lenders plan 1-2% rate cut to save project=20 Lenders to the $3-billion Dabhol Power Project are ready to make ""sacrifice= s"" to save the controversial project from sinking. According to sources, In= dian lenders-Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) and State Bank of India-are considering between one and two percentage point cut in interest rates to bring down the cost of funds for the promoters. Other domestic len= ders ICICI, Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI) and Canara Ba= nk-may also follow suit. The Indian lenders are also not averse to the idea of raising the moratoriu= m on loan repayment by at least one more year The moratorium is currently p= egged at one year. Besides, they are also willing to consider stretching th= e repayment schedule from the existing level of nine years to about 12 year= s. ""The single point agenda is to complete the project. The lenders are rea= dy to make sacrifices if that will help,"" said a source. To bring down cost= s, the Godbole Committee had recommended conversion of the foreign currency= loans into rupee loans.=20 However, at this stage, none of the Indian lenders are willing to do so as it would increase their exposure. But they could, at a later stage, convert= the forex loans into rupee loans. Following the government's external comm= ercial borrowing (ECB) guidelines, 25 per cent of forex loans can be conver= ted every year following the pre-payment route. Both IDBI and SBI had cut i= nterest rates earlier also. While IDBI slashed it from around 19 to 16.5 pe= r cent, SBI cut it from around 17 to 15 per cent. The average interest cost= for the phase I rupee loan is pegged at 16.5 per cent and that of phase II= at 16.11 per cent. A percentage point cut in interest rate can translate t= o only about 2 paise lowering in tariff of the project. The lowering of six= -month Libor from over 5.5 per cent two years back to 4.25 per cent now has= also brought down the cost of forex loans for the project. The Dabhol proj= ect has already had a cost over-run of $150 million.=20 However, this has not been borne by the lenders.

NEW Delhi's intervention in the tussle between Enron and the Maharashtra go= vernment is a welcome development. The government wants the Central Electri= city Authority to find out whether electricity generated by Dabhol Power C= ompany can be sold to states which need power badly if it can't be used by Maharashtra. This is a good idea India is seriously short of reliable, qu= ality electricity supply. Maharashtra claims that it doesn't need even the 740 MW now generated by DPC at going rates. This creates further trouble: t= he lower Maharashtra's offtake, the higher the unit price of DPC power. Onc= e other power hungry states start buying up electricity from DPC, the price= per kilowatt hour will fall sharply.=20 The first step to getting DPC out of the hole that Enron, Maharashtra and s= uccessive Indian governments have dug it into, is to allow the utility to s= ell power to anyone who wants to purchase it at going rates. However, askin= g central utilities like the fledgling Power Trading Corporation to evacuat= e DPC power for sale outside Maharashtra won't solve the hassles of the sec= tor for all time. The government should modify electricity laws to allow ge= nerating companies to sell electricity to all users immediately. An ordinan= ce passed by New Delhi will do the trick power is a concurrent subject, w= ith central legislation overriding states'. But even if that happens, it is= doubtful if there will be too many buyers for Dabhol power at its present price about Rs 4 per unit with the plant running at high capacities. If t= he price is to be brought down further, the deal with MSEB will have to be renegotiated.=20 The Godbole Committee says that some financial restructuring, de-dollarisin= g of debt and equity, and so on can bring prices down by about 30 per cent from DPC's minimum Rs 4 per unit rate today. Otherwise, as the GC points o= ut, it will be impossible for the project to be viable at current tariffs. India desperately needs electricity to grow. For the power sector to grow, reforms are necessary at every level renegotiations, yes, but also change= s in laws and the rules of the game. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Friday, June 01, 2001=20 MSEB sells 2.5 m units to Tata Power, Sanjay Jog THE Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), which has suspended the pow= er purchase from the Dabhol Power Company since May 29 noon, has been selli= ng 2.5 million units at a per unit tariff of around Rs 3.60 to Tata Power. MSEB sources confirmed these developments and told The Financial Express on= Thursday that it will also sell its power to various states if they come f= orward with the proposal. ""We have sold over 5 million units since last th= ree days to Tata Power whose Trombay plant is undergoing certain overhaulin= g,"" sources said. According to sources, MSEB's power supply has not been affected despite it has stopped power purchase from DPC. Thanks to the daily load availability of over 10,000 mw and a frequency of 49 per cent. MSEB has a generating cap= acity of nearly 9,767 mw in addition to this it receives in all 2,185 mw fr= om the National Thermal Power Corporation and Nuclear Power Corporation an= d nearly 190 mw from Tarapur automatic power station.Furthermore, sources s= aid that there has been no peak load shortage neither there has been load s= hedding across the state mainly due to a much needed relief received after pre-monsoon rains and low uptake of power especially from the agricultural consumers due to prevailing drought conditions. Similarly, MSEB's drive to= contain power thefts have started paying off. Moreover, the industrial consumers have shifted their load during night hou= rs when the power availability is more but also at off peak rates. In a rel= ated development, Indian rupee lenders consortium headed by the Industrial Development Bank of India will hold meeting with the MSEB chairman Vinay Ba= nsal on Saturday for apprising him their position over Dabhol impasse. IDBI= along with Indian Financial Institutions (IFIs) have taken a stand that th= e legal issues be kept aside and make united efforts to save their funds cr= ossing over Rs 5,152 crore blocked in the Dabhol project. MSEB sources said= that the IDBI would also be briefed about the circumstances under which it= has filed a petition in the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission after rescinding the power purchase agreement. ""However, we still feel that= MSEB and IDBI should work together to safeguard their interests as well as= their money,"" sources added.=20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Friday, June 01, 2001=20 Dabhol, the FDI we didn't need R Jagannathan The question is not of scrapping the deal, but how and on what terms=20 If there is one thing that stands out in the Dabhol power project controver= sy, it is the surprising unanimity all parties to the conflict have achieve= d: all of them actually want to get out. Enron, main promoters of the Dabho= l Power Company, which got a cushy bargain with no risks, wants to walk out= because it does not see itself as a power-plant runner in the long run. No= r does it want to be seen as the company that stole millions from a poor co= untry by making suckers out of Indian politicians and bureaucrats while neg= otiating the power purchase agreement (PPA). Maharashtra state electricity board (MSEB), a self-declared victim, obviously wants to exit for reasons o= f its own long-term survival. The central and Maharashtra governments would= like to close the chapter since they want to welsh on the guarantees that were foolhardily given to Enron. The only people who still have a stake in the PPA and the deal are mostly Indian financial institutions and banks. Ev= en they are unlikely to hang on if they can see a way to pull their chestnu= ts out of the fire. If no one is ready to admit this, it is because everybo= dy has egg on his face. It is, therefore, best to cut one's losses, learn t= he lessons and move on.=20 The first lesson to be learnt is this: you cannot have a deal where the cos= ts are stated in one currency and prices in another. In the Enron project, MSEB's power purchase costs were linked to the dollar when its revenues wer= e in rupees. The only way it could have taken up this risk was if it knew t= hat the rupee was actually going to strengthen against the dollar in the me= dium term a historically invalid assumption. With dollar-rupee parities l= iving up to past form, the project was a dead duck from day one. Second, any deal done without keeping in mind a customer's willingness to p= ay the required price is folly. The Dabhol PPA makes its obvious that DPC c= onsidered MSEB the customer, when in reality it is the ultimate power users= (factories, offices, farmers, households) who are the real customers. The deal would have worked only if MSEB believed it could raise tariffs by 100 per cent or more every year for several years, or if Enron was given the op= tion to find its own customers and given a distribution area. This implies that the Enron deal could have worked only if power sector reforms had prec= eded the deal, and not followed it. Third, nobody should ever try to guarantee profits to any commercial entity= While it may sometimes make sense to give incentives (free land, tax re= lief) or even forgo revenues (through sales tax deferrals) to lure investme= nt in any given sector, it makes no sense at all to offer to pay anyone mon= ey to ensure his profitability. But this is what the Maharashtra government= and central counter-guarantees amounted to. If the power customer doesn't pay higher tariffs, the Maharashtra government (or its central counter-guar= antor) would make up the shortfall for DPC. Four, the Enron kind of foreign direct investment (FDI) is not something th= at needs to be encouraged. If governments have to bankroll the profits of a= foreign company, if domestic institutions have to guarantee most of the lo= ans, and if local customers are not prepared to pay the price for all that these things cost, what is the point in seeking such investment? McDonald's= and Kellogg's are not here because they are guaranteed pots of money, but because they see a profitable market somewhere in the future. There is no r= eason why power should be any different. In future, if we are going to invi= te foreign investment, it must be on the basis of reforms that make investm= ents inherently viable and not by profit guarantees. Power purchase contrac= ts should be bid for on the basis of guaranteed rupee-based tariffs, subjec= t to reasonable escalation clauses, and not capital costs or dollar-based i= nputs or returns. To exit from the unholy mess, there are only three options: one, the govern= ment can negotiate compensation costs for Enron based on what it has invest= ed and additionally give it a reasonable return on this capital. A new prom= oter may then have to be roped in to finish the project on the basis of a n= ew PPA. He will then have to decide whether the existing contractors can be= retained to complete the project on new or existing terms; and new avenues= have to be found to make the project viable using cheaper and alternative fuels. The tab will, obviously, have to be picked up by the central and Mah= arashtra governments, MSEB and the lenders in some proportion. The key to r= esolving the deadlock lies with Enron: whether it will be mature enough to accept a compensation that is less than what its deal itself specifies. Mr Jagannathan is Editor, myiris.com ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Friday, June 01, 2001=20 DPC expects MSEB to share 50% in $360-m loss on account of tariff cut Sa= njay Jog DABHOL Power Company (DPC) has for the first time come up with a figure of $360 million, which it says is on account of the 10 per cent reduction in t= ariff. This amount was indicated by the DPC at a recent meeting with the Ma= harashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) officials. Interestingly, while t= he DPC expects MSEB to share 50 per cent of this burden, the MSEB, before a= ccepting its part of the burden, wants DPC to give the basis on which this figure has been arrived at.According to DPC, the per unit tariff at 90 per cent availability, will be reduced to Rs 3.50-Rs 3.59 from the estimated Rs= 4.30 after the commissioning of Dabhol phase-II to be run on the liquified= natural gas (LNG). The DPC is of the view that the tariff cut will be poss= ible only if the Centre waives 5 per cent customs duty on LNG and the India= n Financial Institutions (IFIs) restructure the repayment schedule and cut the interest rate to 12 per cent from the prevailing 16.5 per cent. DPC has estimated a suspension period of nearly 18 months, comprising 12 mo= nths for the completion of renegotiations and six months for various other formalities. Sources said that the implementation of tariff cut, if at all agreed by both MSEB and DPC, would be possible after reworking the present power purchase agreement, which has already been rescinded by the MSEB. How= ever, MSEB, which will have to share a burden of $180 million, has asked th= e DPC to explain with a backup data and formula on what basis it has arrive= d at a figure of $360 million. Sources told The Financial Express that the prima facie DPC has ruled out the possibility of cutting the tariff at Rs 2= .50 per unit as demanded by the MSEB on the grounds that it would not even cover the fixed charges, leave aside the variable charges. However, MSEB, a= s reported first by The Financial Express on May 29, wants to stick to its stand that the tariff will have to be brought down at Rs 2.50 per unit. Curiously, MSEB's stand has been supported by the Infrastructure Developmen= t Finance Corporation (IDFC) which is providing secretarial assistance to t= he Madhav Godbole renegotiation committee. MSEB is of the firm view that th= e tariff cut is quite possible only after the DPC delinks dollar linkage, s= eparates its regassification unit from the Dabhol project and also sacrific= es equity earnings in dollar terms. According to sources, DPC has also aske= d the MSEB to submit its formula and backup data to lower the per unit tari= ff at Rs 2.50. However, MSEB officials have told the DPC that it would shar= e necessary data only after seeking approval of the renegotiations committe= e chief Dr Madhav Godbole. The IDFC officials would meet Dr Godbole on this front and thereafter come out with the relevant data pertaining to tariff reduction at the next meeti= ng slated for June 2 between MSEB and DPC officials. In a related developme= nt, MSEB and DPC are believed to have expressed serious doubts over Union m= inister Suresh Prabhu's directives to the Central Electricity Authority (CE= A) to find buyers for the Dabhol power in the wake of the MSEB's decision t= o stop power purchase from Dabhol. They are reportedly doubtful over the fe= asibility and durability of this proposal as it would all depend upon the p= ower demand and the payment capacity of the ""buyer"" state. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= THE INDIAN EXPRESS, Friday, June 01, 2001=20 Enron fallout: Fitch cuts India's rating to negative Fiscal imbalance, Enron row take toll on India's rating International rating agency Fitch today changed the rating outlook on India= 's sovereign ratings from 'stable' to 'negative' citing well-flagged conce= rns about fiscal policy, privatisation, deterioration in the foreign invest= ment climate and the Enron fracas. Fitch currently rates the foreign and lo= cal currency obligations of India 'BB+' and 'BBB-' respectively.The negativ= e rating outlook reflects the slow progress of the government in implementi= ng privatisation and addressing the weaknesses in public finances, it said.= The fiscal-monetary policy mix in India remains unfavourable, resulting in= relatively high real interest rates and crowding out of private sector inv= estment. Italso expressed concern over high government guarantees which c= an become liabilities to various projects in the wake of the Enron imbrog= lio. Fitch also expressed additional concerns over the dispute between Enron, th= e country's largest foreign investor, and the government and worried that t= his may herald a broader deterioration in the foreign investment climate. F= oreign direct investment remains extremely low in India (less than 1 per ce= nt of GDP). Until the authorities display a concerted willingness to addres= s fiscal imbalances, India will remain locked in a stop-go cycle of growth and the sovereign could slip into a debt trap, it said. The recent corrupti= on scandal, involving the ruling BJP-led coalition government, threatens to= exacerbate these trends and further slow economic reform, Fitch said. Indi= a's fiscal deficit at over 9 per cent of GDP is among the highest in the re= alm of rated sovereigns. Persistently high fiscal deficits have led to a bu= ild-up of the general government's debt burden, estimated to be over 60 per= cent of GDP. In addition, the government (both central and state) has guarantees outstan= ding amounting to 9 per cent of GDP. Fitch reiterates the point that such g= uarantees, issued to back mainly infrastructure projects, are contingent li= abilities of the government. This has most recently been borne out in the c= ase of Enron, where the US power company has invoked a c= entral government guarantee for payment arrears accumulated by the MSEB. On= the revenue side, the tax base remains small, while the expenditure profil= e remains rigid due to the high level of interest payments, subsidies, pers= onnel and defence costs. Interest payments comprise nea= rly 50 per cent of revenues, leaving little to be spent on the much-needed infrastructure and social sectors. Fiscal management is also questionable given the repeated slippage in its f= iscal deficits in the past several years. Despite the weak state of public finances, Fitch is disappointed that the government is envisaging only a mo= dest fiscal consolidation in 2001-02 and even this target could prove chall= enging, as growth and revenue projections seem optimist= ic. Although the budget contains some positive structural reform measures, the Tehelka scandal and State elections next year could put pressure on the= government to delay these initiatives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= THE INDIAN EXPRESS, Friday, June 01, 2001=20 As Enron backs out, NTPC steps in with 2 mega plans NTPC to set up coal-based plants in Maharashtra WHILE private sector power producers like Enron are finding the going tough= in Maharashtra, government-owned National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC)= has decided to set up two new mega power projects in the State. This is de= spite Enron's Dabhol project is sputtering and projects ofReliance and Ispa= t have failed to get government clearances.NTPC plans to set up two 1,000 m= w plus coal-based power plants in Vidarbha and Konkan areas of Maharashtra with an investment of more than Rs 4,000 crore each. ""NTPC does not have a power plant in the state, so in order to make our presence, we have shortli= sted Mauda near Nagpur for setting up a power station with two units of 500= mw each,"" said NTPC executive director (western region) R D Gupta. ""While private power producers have found it tough running power plants, g= overnment utilities seem to be quietly consolidating their position in spit= e of huge dues,"" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage. NTPC alone has d= ues of over Rs 16,000 crore from various state electricity boards. ""The loc= ation for Konkan will be finalised soon as we are yet to select suitable la= nd for the project,"" Gupta added. For the Vidarbha project, the Corporation= has been able to finalise the prospects of coal availability and was await= ing State's response on procurement of water, Gupta said, adding ""For the c= oastal plant, NPTC is looking for imported coal, which would be later blend= ed with the Indian quality for usage.""=20 The State government, which is in a battle with Enron over the Dabhol proje= ct, had recently put on hold providing an escrow cover and signing of power= purchase agreement with NTPC for the purchase of additional power from its= new projects. The government has, in no uncertain terms, also expressed it= s inability to consider an escrow cover at this point of time especially wh= en the Madhav Godbole energy review committee is in the process of finalisa= tion of its report on reforms and restructuring of ailing Maharashtra State= Electricity Board (MSEB). Simultaneously, neither the State nor MSEB were in a position to give any assurance on purchase of power from NTPC's upcomi= ng projects especially when the State was meeting the power demand with the= present installed capacity of over 12,000 mw. The government had told the NTPC that the escrow cover would not be require= d in the wake of proposed implementation of Montek Singh Ahluwalia report o= n one time settlement of dues of state electricity boards (SEBs). Similarly= the government made it clear that it would not be possible for provide es= crow cover in the wake of current 'precarious' financia= l conditions. NTPC pressed for PPAs for the supply of additional power of 1= ,345 mw from Kawas II (202 mw), Gandhar II (186 mw), Vindhyachal II (319 mw= and Sipat (638 mw). NTPC has already been providing around 1,900 mw to 2,= 400 mw to the MSEB. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= THE INDIAN EXPRESS, Friday, June 01, 2001=20 Darkness over Dabhol There can be no excuses for these monumental 'enwrongs' NOTHING confirms the need for transparency in decision-making more forceful= ly than the Dabhol Power Company imbroglio. Operations at the power station= have been stopped for a second time since the original contract was signed= In 1994, alleging corruption in the deal, the then Shiv Sena-BJP governme= nt ordered suspension of the project but soon backtr= acked and signed a new contract, three times the size of the first.

For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a lump I found under my arm. As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an ultrasound of my breast. Both test came back abnormal and I am seeing a specialist this week to determine if I need to have a biopsy or not. Since God has given me the task of doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy. I trust and believe that God will heal. God gave me a revelation several months ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our family, we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you at this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten mad. So he has decided to try and pull me down once again. I refuse to be brought down off this spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God. That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors I need you to be in prayer with me this week. I see the specialist on Thursday and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.

Discover quick trades and easy profits in a little- known sector that has quietly gone 'bull' while the broader markets tumble. For your FREE report click here: Resource Trader Alert <URL> * * * * * * * * * * * * Market Watch This section of the Daily Reckoning is usually written by Eric Fry, editor of Grantsinvestor.com. Look for Eric on TV this week; he's the guest host on CNN-FN, 9:30 11 E.S.T. My notes and letter follow, as usual. The rally seems to have stalled. The Dow fell 166 points yesterday. The Nasdaq was down 91. Consumers are still spending...but a closer look at the numbers reveals the weakness. Half of April's 0.04% increase in consumer spending is attributable to higher prices. And earnings, too, reduced for inflation, rose at only 0.01% during the month. Looking more carefully at how consumers were spending their money, we find that they were still buying bread and beer but not big ticket items, such as cars and homes. Bankruptcy filings rose 17.5% to a new record for a first quarter. Scylla and Charybdis must be closing in. Will lower stock prices further reduce consumer spending? ""The ups and downs of the stock market,"" reports the Wall Street Journal, summarizing a Fed study, ""don't foreshadow where the economy is headed. They drive it directly."" Lower stock prices, less consumer spending. Less consumer spending, less business investment and lower profits. Lower profits, low stock prices. We're a long way from a major buying opportunity, opines Daniel Turov in Barron's. ""The Dow first reached the 100 level in January 1906,"" he writes. ""It traded above and below that level for more than 36 years; it wasn't until May 1942 that the market left 100 behind for the last time."" ""The Industrial Average first reached 1,000 in February 1966,"" he continues. ""It traded above and below that level for the next 17 years, leaving it for the last time in February 1983. ""The Dow first reached the 10,000 level in March 1999. Considering the unprecedented gains of the past several years, would it be that unusual for this benchmark to take a decade or even two before leaving 10,000 in the dust for the last time?"" Investing in Latin America is risky. Argentina is on the verge of a financial crisis. But Argentina is always on the verge of some sort of crisis. Meanwhile, there are some good companies at bargain prices, Barron's reports. I don't know what Repsol does. But whatever it is, the Argentinian company gets little respect from investors for doing it. The $10 billion company is trading at 8 times earnings. Petrobras, the huge Brazilian energy business, can be bought for just 6 times earnings. And Mexico's telecom, Telmex, can be yours for just 10 times this year's earnings. But a warning. There is no law that says things that are cheap can't get cheaper. Gold closed yesterday at just $267 an ounce. Gold mining stocks fell 5%. ""I have seen 23 investment manias,"" writes Ray Devoe, ""ranging from uranium producers, to bowling companies, airlines and color TV. Four of them were high-technology (including space exploration and scientific instruments). With the possible exception of 1968's 'Great Garbage Market' all of them were localized-so that when the bubbles burst, the impact on the economy was negligible. ""However, this time it is different in that the bubble in stocks was (and is) so widespread. This time bursting bubbles are much more likely to negatively impact the economy."" (see: Good Intentions and Their Unintended Consequences <URL> ""Accelerated Entropy,"" is what Dan Denning of the Daily Reckoning Blue Team calls it. ""Businesses suffer from entropy in the same way organic life forms do. Trouble is, in the 21st century entropy naturally built into the business cycle is picking up speed... destroying some businesses faster than ever."" And a few notes from Bill: A friend sent me a copy of my horoscope for last week: ""Keep your financial advice to yourself,"" advised the stars. If only I had listened. I would not now be in the embarrassing position of trying to explain the depressing fall in gold prices down $7.70 yesterday alone. And the euro! At 85 cents it only has a few mills to go before it hits a new all time low. But what can you expect from the euro? I dubbed it the ""Esperanto currency"" when it came out. Backed by neither a single government nor by gold, the euro is a monetary curiosity, a money based on good intentions.wishful thinking.and who knows what else.. And, as James Grant points out, it is a paper currency that isn't even available on paper. They don't release the actual bills until next year. So far, it is just electronic ether. Perhaps, as Grant suggests, I should do what Wall Street analysts do...and change my 'buy' recommendation for the euro to a 'hold' ..or a 'market perform.' And maybe gold should become an 'accumulate,' rather than an un- hedged long position. Maybe I should just give up and admit that the gold and the euro may someday be decent places for your money...but their time has not yet come. But what's the point? You don't cancel a life insurance program just because you aren't dead yet. ""The median corporate bond rating stands at BBB, or weak investment grade,"" reports Grant in Forbes, ""the lowest since 1981, the first year for which statistics are available. Also, just 28% of the junk-bond universe holds the top junk rating, according to Moody's Investors Service. That's the lowest proportion in at least 80 years, a span that includes the Depression."" Last night, my friend Mark Skousen came to town. He is on a world tour, promoting his most recent book (about which more.after I've read it). Mark gave a lecture at the Democratic Liberal party headquarters in Paris luring the biggest turnout of free-market supporters in many years. Yes, there were probably 15 of us there.at least.

We were painting shutters on Sunday afternoon. Painting is not my favorite past-time, dear reader. It is tedious and repetitive. But it has one virtue it lends itself to conversation. If I have any advice to give to the families of America, it is this: throw out the television and pick up painting brushes. The family that paints together, sticks together. Well, at least their hair sticks together. Jules, Maria, and Sophia each had an answer for Benoit. But none could offer a convincing explanation of why or how the two countries differ. All agreed, however, that America is a 'freer' place. Even the Frenchman, Alexis de Tocqueville, noticed it early in the 19th century. Americans were unrestrained... bound neither by law, custom, taste or dignity. The frontier was especially wild, he noted, as uncivilized as the people who inhabited it. Since Tocqueville took his famous tour of America, much has changed. The frontier has been tamed. So have its inhabitants. As noted here many times, since America gained its freedom from Britain, America's citizens have become the serfs of their own government. Americans worked from January 1st until January 8th each year, roughly, to pay their obligations to George 3rd. Today, successful Americans work from January 1st to June 1st to pay their tribute to George W's government. Still, my children as well as most of the world's people are convinced that America remains a 'freer' place than France. An article in Forbes reports that it takes just 7 days to start a business in the U.S., but 66 days in France. In its ranking of the ""best places in the world to start a business"" Forbes places the U.S. as #1. France is #25. I've begun businesses in both countries. The numbers may be technically correct, but they focus on the wrong part of the story. The big difference between France and America is not the difficulty of starting a business, but the trouble of getting out of an unsuccessful one. Marks and Spencers, the British retailer with a store around the corner from my office, decided to close its doors in France after losing money for years. Uh...not so fast. The employees kicked up a fuss and a French court ordered M&S to stay in business until a settlement was reached. Operating stores reduced hours and empty shelves has added millions to the firm's losses. Several investment strategists including our own Steve Sjuggerud and Steve Hanke conclude that you should always invest in countries that are moving towards more commercial liberty. But if you followed that advice literally, you would have taken your money out of the U.S. 150 years ago. And you would miss the benefits of investing in socialism. France is a more demanding and unforgiving place than America. The schools are harder. Teachers do not worry about a child's self-esteem. If wrong answers are given, or untidy work is handed in, the poor children are scolded and, often, insulted. Children are expected to stand up straight, look guests in the eye and offer their cheeks for a kiss. People are expected to dress properly when they go out and always move to the right hand lane when driving...leaving the left lanes open for speeders. Husbands may have mistresses, but they are expected to be discreet about it. Rigidity is not without its benefits. Women are prettier and the food is generally better. In the business world, it is hard to get started eliminating the casual entrepreneurs but once you are established, government regulations raise up behind you like a drawbridge, to block potential competitors. Conduct your affairs in the proper way and all of French society will conspire to keep you in business. France is a socialist country, with a very expensive national health care system subsidized transportation, and regulations governing almost every aspect of life (just like America!) Workers enjoy a 35-hour work week...with 4 weeks of vacation. But this puts pressure on enterprises to make sure their employees are productive. And while French workers tend to work fewer hours (no one works as many hours as Americans) it is rare to find workers as incompetent as those you routinely encounter in the U.S. ""But the real difference between the U.S. and France,"" observed one of the attendees at Mark Skousen's lecture last night, ""is that the intellectual tradition of economic liberty never really caught on in France."" In Anglo-Saxon countries, Adam Smith popularized the notion of an ""invisible hand"" guiding individual market transactions for the benefit of all. How come those ideas never took root in France? Neither Mark nor any of the attendees had a good answer. In fact, the discussion merely deepened the mystery. Because it was in France that the idea of ""laissez-faire"" economics was first developed. Montesquieu, Say, Tocqueville, Bastiat they elaborated the ideas of financial liberty long before Ayn Rand or Milton Friedman. ""In fact,"" added Henri Lepage, host of last night's meeting, ""Bastiat anticipated what is now known as 'public choice theory' long before James Buchanan was born. But what happened? ""They died,"" said one attendee. ""A similar phenomenon occurred in America,"" Mark pointed out, ""the New England colonies, especially Massachusetts, were the most radical, liberty-obsessed part of the nation in 1776. But, today they are the most socialist states."" Why? An explanation...tomorrow. Bill Bonner * * * * Advertisement * * * * When The Greatest Credit Bubble in History Bursts...What Comes Next? No banks or brokerage houses went bust in the 1929 crash. In fact, many investors and businessmen prospered. The real damage was done later on when popular sentiment turned against stocks altogether.

The last few months have revealed an alarming trend in the Government of the United States attempting to quietly push through legislation that will affect our use of the Internet. Under proposed legislation, the US Postal Service will be attempting to bill E-mail users out of ""alternative postage fees."" Bill 602P will permit the Federal Government to charge a 5-cent surcharge on every e-mail delivered, by billing Internet Service Providers at source. The consumer would then be billed in turn by the ISP. Washington DC lawyer Richard Stepp is working without pay to prevent this legislation from becoming law. The US Postal Service is claiming lost revenue, due to the proliferation of E-mail, is costing nearly $230,000,000 in revenue per year. You may have noticed their recent ad campaign: ""There is nothing like a letter."" Since the average person received about 10 pieces of E-mail per day in 1998, the cost of the typical individual would be an additional 50 cents a day or over $180 per year above and beyond their regular Internet costs. Note that this would be money paid directly to the US Postal Service for a service they do not even provide. The whole point of the Internet is democracy and noninterference. You are already paying an exorbitant price for snail mail because of bureaucratic inefficiency. It currently takes up to 6 days for a letter to be delivered from coast to coast. If the US Postal Service is allowed to tinker with E-mail, it will mark the end of the ""free"" Internet in the United States. Congressional representative, Tony Schnell (R) has even suggested a ""$20-$40 per month surcharge on all Internet service"" above and beyond the governments proposed E-mail charges. Note that most of the major newspapers have ignored the story the only exception being the Washingtonian which called the idea of E-mail surcharge ""a useful concept who's time has come"" (March 6th, 1999 Editorial). Do not sit by and watch your freedom erode away! Send this E-mail to EVERYONE on your list, and tell all your friends and relatives to write their congressional representative and say ""NO"" to Bill 602P. It will only take a few moments of your time and could very well be instrumental in killing a bill we do not want.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"": Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.

christi.nicolay@enron.com,"WEST DESKS--FERC authorizes power marketers to purchase from industrials (and more) On March 14, 01, FERC issued an ""Order removing obstacles to increased electric generation and gas supply in the West.."" (Docket No. EL01-47). Most significantly, FERC authorizes industrials in WSCC to sell power to licensed power marketers (like EPMI and EES) effective 3/14/01 through 12/31/01. The industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC (subject to EPMI and EES making filings for the industrials). (This is similar to the authorization that EPMI and EES requested nationwide earlier this year we should hear from FERC on that request by mid-May.) In addition, FERC authorizes DSM sales at wholesale at market based rates. Specifics: Owners of generating facilities located at business locations in the WSCC and used primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be ""public utilities"" subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell power at wholesale from such facilities to non-affiliated entities (like EPMI or EES) without prior notice under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice filing). Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while they are selling at wholesale. EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the industrials for any of these purchases. Our report must show the names of the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller. Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be separate from our big quarterly reports. This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any rules or tariffs of its host utility. This does not authorize an industrial to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff must file a rate schedule at FERC for this, but FERC will be receptive to granting waivers and authorizations. This authorization expires after 12/31/01. Effective 3/14/01 through 12/31/01, retail customers in WSCC, as permitted by state laws and regulations, and wholesale customers are authorized to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load reduction at wholesale at market-based rates. These transactions can occur in several ways: An aggregator can line up retail load to acquire enough negawatts to resell in a manner similar to what aggregators do when they sell power to retail load under retail choice programs. In addition, wholesale and retail load with contract demand service could resell their contract demands if the value of power is greater than the value of consumption. Similar quarterly reports would be due by EPMI/EES. NOTE: the industrial still has to obtain the interconnection agreement with transmission provider (may need new interconnection facilities, etc.) Remember that you still need to get transmission on OASIS when the power is wheeled away from the industrial. Other initiatives in the order: Utilities are encouraged to make DSM arrangements with wholesale customers. FERC waives the prior notice requirement for amended contracts that are required to be filed at FERC. Clarifies that DSM should be treated consistenly with all other types of incremental and out-of-pocket costs for utilities. Reminds transmission providers to keep ATCs current, including CBM and TRM. Provides incentive rates for new transmission projects that can be in service by July 1 (and to a lesser extent by November 1 of 01 and 02). Considers ""rolled in"" rates for generation interconnection (rather than direct assignment that we have now.) Extends temporary waivers through 12/31/01 of operating and efficiency standards for QFs. Allows QF to sell output above historical supply though a negotiated bilateral agreement at market based rates, if sold in California and the WSCC. FERC will review interconnection issues that impede generation from reaching load (ie, if a utility does not act within time limits on interconnection requests, etc.) Provides for increased staff and quicker gas pipeline additions review. Please let me know if you would like the order. Ray Alvarez (202-466-9170) and I (713-853-7007) can assist you with this. Thanks. ",0

slgoza@tva.gov,"TVA' s Bid Rogers, TVA's current bid is $4.75/kw-month, for the term May 1, 2001, through December 31, 2003. Enron could call on units not being dispatched by TVA only if TVA specifically agreed to waive its rights for the specific period. If the AAF is equal to or less than 50% for a month, then the Demand Charge for that month will be zero instead of $2/kw-month. Having the potential of 72 hours of scheduled maintenance per unit each month significantly reduces the availability of the resources and the low guaranteed availability during the non-summer also reduces the value to TVA. Should Enron desire to provide a higher level of availability such as not excluding the maintenance from the availability calculation or different product such as unit capacity with LD energy, then that would increase the value to TVA. A transaction of this duration is subject to TVA Board approval. Please let me know if the bid is acceptable, or if Enron want to offer a product with higher availability.

larry@cyberiandesign.com,"Demand Ken Lay Donate Proceeds from Enron Stock Sales Larry Doyle larry@cyberiandesign.com To Mr. Ken Lay, I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills. Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees. Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out. And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year. As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt. The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it. Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings. Sincerely, Larry Doyle",1
thailu@ercot.com,"MARKET NOTIFICATION OF SYSTEM CHANGE (PRR-294) MARKET NOTIFICATION OF SYSTEM CHANGE PIP Number(s): 144, 200 PRR Number(s): 294 Protocol Section(s): 4.4.4, 6.3.1, 11.4.1.1 Implementation Date: January 18, 2002 Description of System Change: ERCOT plans to implement PIP 144/PRR 294 (Load Ratio Shares per LSE) and PIP 200 (LSE Load Ratio and Loss Allocation) on January 18, 2002. The Protocol revision for PIP 144 impacts sections 4.4.4 and 6.3.1 of the Protocols. The revision for PIP 200 is documented in section 11.4.1.1 of the protocols. Currently, ERCOT calculates ancillary service obligations for each QSE for a given trade day based on the QSE's aggregated Load Ratio Share as of the same day of the prior week. This results in the use of QSE/LSE relationships from one week prior to calculate ancillary service obligations. When an LSE switches from one QSE to another, the obligation associated with its load continue to be allocated to the old QSE for one week after the effective date of the switch. The same obligation does not get allocated to the new QSE for the first week after the switch. QSEs also do not have access to Load Ratio Share data per LSE that makes up their ancillary service obligations. This modification will alter the way the QSE Load Ratio Shares are aggregated so that ancillary service obligations are calculated based on the QSE/LSE relationships that will be effective on the trade day for which obligations are being posted. Load Ratio Shares will be calculated and saved by LSE during the data aggregation process run for initial settlement of the trade day in question. QSE Load Ratio Share will then be aggregated and posted for a given trade day based on the sum of LSE Load Ratio Shares calculated as described above corresponding to the most current QSE/LSE relationships for that trade day. Scheduled Extract Changes: Billing determinants for LSE Load Ratio Shares called LRSLSE will be added to the load extract. Each QSE will have the LRSLSE fields added to its load extract for each LSE it represents. Each LSE will also have the LRSLSE field added to its load extract with its Load Ratio Share information. Dynamic Extract: The Settlement and Billing folder within the archive extracts area of the portal will have an additional dynamic extract folder added called ""Obligations"". This dynamic extract folder will have two extracts called ""QSE obligations"" and ""LSE obligations"" which can be used to query Load Ratio Shares by QSE and LSE. The following ERCOT total quantities will also be added to the dynamic extracts above: Total obligated non-spinning quantity (NSOTOT) Total obligated regulation down quantity (RDOTOT) Total obligated responsive reserve quantity (RROTOT) Total obligated regulation up quantity (RUOTOT) You can find details of PRR-294 at the following link: <URL> If you have any questions, please call your ERCOT client service representative.

lokay@bigfoot.com,"unverified news report China Blames U. S. for Second Mid-Air Collision BEIJING (Reuters) Chinese officials have stated that they are holding the United States, ""fully responsible"" for today's mid-air collision, involving several Chinese aircraft and one American craft. This comes just weeks after a similar incident involving a U. S. spy plane. Officials have stated that at approximately 8:25 a.m., GMT, a squadron of Chinese F-8 fighters collided with the American Goodyear Blimp. The crash left over a dozen Chinese planes downed and the blimp's electronic billboard damaged. Sources say the billboard's scrolling marquee had been advertising 7-UP soft drink, leaving the line ""Up yours"" in view. A Chinese pilot who witnessed the collision between his squadron, nicknamed, ""Panda Rash"" told China's Xinhua news agency that he saw the American blimp dive out of the clouds and into wingman Sum Yung Phucker's F-8 jet. ""I told Yung Phucker his tail was all broken. Keep it straight. Keep it straight',"" said the pilot. ""He just couldn't shake the American foreign-devil. The blimp then reportedly veered hard left and then right,taking out the rest of the squadron. Pilot Chawp Suey Wussy told Xinhua the American blimp was ""fully responsible for the incident,"" repeating the language Beijing has used in the earlier incident. China blames this new accident on the Goodyear blimp, saying it rammed the supersonic fighters, and has demanded an apology. Officials from the Goodyear Company have said it is unlikely that the slow propeller-driven blimp could turn inside and ram a dozen nimble fighters, unless the Chinese were testing chimp pilots. ""The direct cause of the collision was that the American blimp made a sudden big move toward the Chinese planes, making it impossible for the Chinese planes to get out of the way,"" Suey Wussy was quoted as saying. ""The savage act of American blimps colliding with Chinese planes while conducting spying activities at sporting events makes us indignant,"" he was quoted as saying. Chinese officials are calling for an apology from the United States and enough Goodyear tires to replace the Firestone's that experienced spontaneous combustion last year. U. S. officials expressed regret, but would not allow an apology until the matter could be investigated further. In a related story Goodyear has not commented on whether it has stopped shipments of condoms to China as a retaliatory measure. ",1

This week, we've made some rather significant changes to the Deaths page on the site. And we're working on several more. For starters, we've combined the pages with the news articles and the local death notices from the Classifieds section into a single page. This way, you get to all of the daily information we have all at once. In addition to the obituaries and death notices, we've added links to additional resources both for genealogical purposes and for those needing to make plans for a funeral. We'll add more links in this area as they become available. For instance, there's a link for an online search of birth and death records for Harris County now but not for the City of Houston or for the State of Texas. Those latter two governmental units don't provide online searches of their records yet. When they do, we'll add the links. And, yes, we are working to include Mic Barnette's Saturday column on genealogy from the newspaper. The page still has a search box for the local death notices (and other funerary categories) from the Classifieds section, but we don't think you will need it very often. We are listing all of the local notices being published each day on the page now, and we've included links on the left side navigation of the page for notices from the entire week just passed. There's still a lot of hand work and construction going on here; so please be patient with us. We don't have a real search engine in this area yet; so we are going to try to rearrange the file by hand each morning so the notices are listed in alphabetical order. (Occasionally, other tasks will push this work back and it will not happen as early as either of us would like, which is why we also are working on a routine to make the computers do this job.) Another ongoing programming task for this page is to develop a true archives database and search for the local notices we have saved by hand online going back to October of 1997. However, until this task is completed, you can search for past notices through a two-step precess. We have a surname index for all of the death notices in the Chronicle's archives system; so you can use the archives gateway to determine whether or not a notice was published for a particular individual and when. Once knowing the date the notice was published, you can see if we saved it online by using a special URL <URL> where ""YY"" is a two-digit year (like 97, 99, 00, etc.), ""MM"" is a two-digit month (like 01, 07, 11, etc.) and ""DD"" is a two-digit date (like 01, 09, 18, 23, etc.). We know this is cumbersome, which is why we are working on a better way of doing it, but this will work to get to the past notices we do have until then. Thanks for visiting, and please party carefully so we don't find your name on the new Deaths page this season. Mike Read Editor ""Pro-Tem,"" HoustonChronicle.com News mike@chron.com What's New at HoustonChronicle.com Shopping Online It only seems that shopping is the reason for the season at this time of year. We try to a measure of balance on both our Holidays and Religion pages, but this is the major shopping period of every year. But we would be remiss if we didn't try to do our part to help keep the economy moving along; so we would like to take this opportunity to point out the Chronicle e-shops area of the site in case you haven't looked it over before. Chronicle e-shops is a partnership with Point Shop on Houston Chronicle.com. It's an online shopping area offering merchandise from businesses throughout the country, quickly and reliably available for delivery before Christmas right from the convenience of your Web browser. Election Without End Yes, another week is gone and the Florida vote that will determine who the next president will be still is up in the air. Right now, we're all waiting on a U.S. Supreme Court hearing scheduled for Monday on whether or not to allow a recount ordered by the Florida Supreme Court. So far the George W. Bush organization has been successful in fighting off vote recounts that might show that Al Gore won the Florida vote, and time may now be the Bush campaign's strongest argument. With each passing day, the time required for a manual recount gets squeezed tighter and tighter. Also, the Florida Legislature will be meeting this week to consider naming its own slate of delegates, which inevitably would be pledged to Bush since the Florida Legislature is overwhelmingly controlled by Republicans. If Bush gets the Florida electors, he will win the presidency by two votes 271-269 in the Electoral College. We're as confused as anybody, but we'll keep posting the latest developments on the Election Politics page. High School Football And you thought the election was endless... Katy will be playing in the 5A Division II semifinals next Saturday in College Station as the only Houston-area team still working on a state title. But both Bay City and LaGrange have some Houston following, along with teams from West Orange-Stark and even Corpus Christi and San Antonio. And we'll keep following along on the High School Sports page in the Sports section of the site until the very last down is played.

susan.scott@enron.com,"What does it really mean to be an altruist? Main Entry: al?tru?ism Pronunciation: 'al-tru-""i-z&m Etymology: French altruisme, from autrui other people, from Old French, oblique case form of autre other, from Latin alter Date: 1853 1 unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others We got to talking about you at lunch today. Rudy mentioned that in effort to get your goat he often tells you your not being very altruistic towards him by consuming so much of his time requesting reports. My understanding is that your typical response to this is ""I am the most altruistic person."" I am sure you recognize the hypocrisy laden in this statement. If a true altruist is unselfish then he would not care if his acts are recognized or not. In fact, the true altruist hopes only that his acts benefit those to which they are directed. We may have to downgrade you to ""concerned individual"". But given your good-hearted and idealistic leanings I thought you would might like to know that the Landmark River Oaks Theatre is going to be showing Mr. Smith Goes to Washington Saturday and Sunday at 10:00 a.m. If you haven't seen the film it's a black and white starring Jimmy Stewart as an idealistic, extremely unselfish young man who takes on the corrupt political machines of Washington, D.C. The film ranked 29th on AFI's (The American Film Institute) top 100 films of the Century list, and is tied for first place on the Sscott5 Greatest Films List.. FYI- Neither you nor Nick have been removed from the group email, I simply haven't sent one out in the past two weeks. I will make sure you both receive my next brilliant composition.

joko8674@163.net,"Company-Cash- Flow-Problem? ATTENTION BUSINESS OWNER OR OPERATOR .s|21 From time to time, most companies experience a cash flow problem. These problems can range from temporary cash crunches with the inability to pay trade creditors and suppliers within the granted credit terms to more serious problems including bankruptcy and liquidation. If you own or operate a company with a cash flow problem, we can help. We are a national consulting company specializing in reducing problem debts for companies of all sizes. Since our inception in 1989, we have helped hundreds of companies including small ""mom and pops"" to large multi-national organizations. We keep our clients out of the legal system so they can concentrate on their business enabling a large savings in both time and money. We typically reduce our clients accounts payable and other debts to less than 20 cents on the dollar! In fact, our settlements rarely go higher than 35 cents on the dollar. Furthermore, we put our clients in a no lose situation. We always give them the opportunity to accept or reject any settlement we negotiate for them. If they do not like the settlement we negotiated, we charge them nothing. If they accept, our fee is based on a small percentage of what we saved them over the original amount owed. Therefore, we don't charge by the hour, never charge a retainer, but only get paid when you accept a satisfactory settlement that we have negotiated on your behalf. If your creditors are constantly calling your company for payment, or have even retained a collection agency or attorney, I strongly urge you to fill out the form below and fax it back to us. Just imagine what your cash and working capital positions would look like in a few short weeks after an 80% reduction of debt. You have absolutely nothing to lose. Please fill out this form and fax to 1-775-599-3416. If this line is busy, please try faxing to 1-775-599-3092.

I am not sure why Dana values his opinions so much on this topic. Keep working the progress. The key people you need to make happy are Robert and Dan. I trust that Mike is developing a effective relationship with them and Dana. Trust is essential in making this partnership work.' I've been meeting with a nunber of the ETS folks that have been working on EOTT issues and assignments, and although we have been working hard, we simply have some additional work to do in the areas of communication, which I will address and facilitate. We meet with the commercial folks on Tuesday after the normal EOTT Staff Meeting regarding the Enhanced Integrity Plan, where we can hopefully move forward. In addition, I will put together a presentation outlining the 2002 EOTT Integrity Plan for presentation the next time the commercial folks meet. It will also include facts of our on-going remediation plan and hydrotest pigging efforts for 2001. In my opinion, the EOTT operations assignment has been a challenge for ETS. ETS and Phil in particular has dedicated tremendous effort to significantly enhance EOTT operations. Few could have tackled the EOTT operational challenges as well as Phil has. Besides the fact that it may not have been a popular decision at EOTT to relinquish control of Operations, he has done an outstanding job in keeping his staff focused on performance with integrity and quality, all the time within a financial framework that adds value to the overall picture of Enron and EOTT. It has not been easy. I am confident you recognize how well he has changed the face of operations in ETS and EOTT as you have changed the face of both organizations overall.

dkg@enernetok.com,"RE: Bonepile: Enron WHGGS Mortg age Agreement Dan, The Campbell county clerk refused to record the State of WY Lease because it does not contain an acknowledgment. The clerk, however, said that they would record a certified copy. The State Land Office no longer provides certified copies of their oil and gas leases, ergo, we could not record a certified copy of the lease. If you want to record the lease, I'll have Gregg Colton at Pioneer Oil and Gas send the original lease to you to be recorded as an attachment to an affadavit of identification. At this stage of the process, I think it more expeditious for you to control that process too. Short of recording the lease, you can confirm the ownership of the lease through the WY Office of State Lands and Investments, Phone 307 777 7331; fax 307 777 5400; email slfmail@missc.state.wy.us. EOW can send it for recording also as an attachment to an affadavit but the recording process is slow in the county because of the tremendous volume of recording transactions ie., 2 weeks plus.

richard.costigan@asm.ca.gov,"FYI LA Times story on sales tax increase Sales Tax to Rise by a Quarter of a Cent Finance: A 1991 law triggers a reduction in good times and kicks it back up during slowdowns. The state deficit means a higher rate on Jan. 1. By JULIE TAMAKI TIMES STAFF WRITER November 1 2001 SACRAMENTO Gov. Gray Davis' administration is expected to confirm today that state sales taxes will rise next year by a quarter of a cent, a development eagerly awaited by Republicans who want to make taxes an issue in next year's elections. A 1991 law enacted by Davis' Republican predecessor provided that in good times--when the state budget surplus tops 4% of the general fund for two years straight--the state sales tax automatically drops by one-fourth of 1% for one year. That reduction kicked in for the first time in January. Now the year is almost up, and state finance officials must determine by today whether the higher rate will reappear next year. Their decision, however, is a foregone conclusion, because there is no surplus, lawmakers already have approved a budget that counts on the additional tax money and state revenues are running more than $1 billion below projections. The sales tax rate throughout nearly all of Los Angeles County will rise to 8.25%. The rate in Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties is expected to climb to 7.75%. Sales tax in Ventura County is expected to increase to 7.25%. Even with the hike, which will take effect Jan. 1 and add roughly $1.2 billion to California coffers in 2002, the state's budget deficit for the fiscal year is projected to be $8 billion to $14 billion. The tax is a political headache for Davis, who took credit when the tax rate fell in January. That was due, he said, to his administration's commitment to fiscal responsibility in addition to the strong economy. Republican lawmakers, who fought this summer to maintain the lower rate, blame the uptick on deficit spending by their Democratic counterparts. ""The budget the governor signed spent over $79 billion when we were only taking in $75 billion,"" Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said. ""This is why the quarter-cent tax is triggering back on."" Republicans contend California taxes are set to rise just as federal lawmakers contemplate an economic stimulus package that has Washington Republicans pushing for steep tax cuts. ""We ought to be generating an economic stimulus that is complementary to what is being done on the federal level,"" Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said. GOP candidates running for state offices next year will be encouraged by party leaders to raise the tax increase as an issue in their campaigns, said James Fisfis, a spokesman for Cox. ""We expect candidates to talk about it, particularly as the economy continues to slump,"" Fisfis added. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Steve Peace, an El Cajon Democrat, lauded the trigger that controls the tax as the best way to allow voters to hold on to a portion of a large budget reserve when times are good. When times are tough, the trigger causes the tax to reappear. ""It's exactly how Pete Wilson designed it to work,"" Peace said. The issue of stimulating the economy is clearly a sensitive one for Davis. On Wednesday, administration officials held a teleconference with reporters to trumpet financing by the state's Infrastructure Bank to help a biomedical center in San Francisco double in size. Davis did not participate but said in a recorded message that the project shows that the state is helping to spark the economy and create new jobs in important fields. Davis is scheduled to convene an economic summit of California business leaders and politicians Friday at the Walt Disney Co. movie studios in Burbank. The governor has warned most state agencies to prepare for 15% budget cuts, imposed a hiring freeze and ordered a $150-million reduction in state spending in the current fiscal year. A budget deal struck earlier this year between Republicans and Democrats presumably made it easier for a quarter-cent tax cut to kick in by requiring the state finance director to determine two things: The reserve at the end of the fiscal year must be at least 3% of general fund revenues, excluding money generated from the quarter-cent sales tax, and general fund revenues from May to September must exceed the forecast, which they have not.

phillip.allen@enron.com,"Questions about 12/29 rentroll: There were two deposits that were not labeled. One for $150 and the other for $75. Which apartments? 20a or #13? Utility overages for #26 and #44? Where did you get these amounts? For what periods? What is going on with #42. Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!! That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling. I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes. If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor. Then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. This tenant has been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off. I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank. Is this right? Has the deposit been made yet? A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly. Phillip",0

Despite a down market dominated by news of the te= rrorist attacks, poor earnings estimates and increasing corporate layoffs, a bright spot has emerged that has created a potentially huge buying oppor= tunity for investors who act immediately. In an attempt to improve market= conditions, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has temporarily r= elaxed regulatory restrictions governing company stock buybacks. This move has created a fervor on Wall Street, resulting in 150 new buyback announcem= ents over the past week alone, with additional companies announcing stock b= uybacks every day. ""This announcement gives investors who focus on stock= buybacks a serious advantage in the current market,"" says David Fried, edi= tor of the highly-successful advisory The Buyback Letter ""Investors shoul= d be careful, however, since not every company announcing a stock buyback i= s necessarily a good company to invest in. Investors will want to separate= the good investment candidates from the bad before purchasing the stock.""= The move temporarily lifts a ban on companies repurchasing their stock i= n the first or last half hour of trading. Additionally, a company which was= normally restricted to purchasing only 25% of its average daily trading vo= lume in a given day can now purchase an amount of stock equal to 100% of th= e average daily trading volume in its stock for the prior month. ""Compani= es can now buy back their stocks while share prices are at their weakest,"" Fried says. ""As these companies reduce their shares outstanding, the earnin= gs per share increase, making each share more valuable. This is ultimately reflected in share prices."" In the current issue of The Buyback Letter (av= ailable FREE for 30 days from INVESTools Fried uncovers eight undervalue= d ""Best Buy"" stocks that represent your best value right now. Insiders in t= hese eight companies are bullish about their firms, and management are buyi= ng back their stock on the open market. Since March, 1997, Fried's 20-Sto= ck Buyback Index has gained 137.69%, vs. a mere 52.67% for the S&P 500. His= 5-stock Buyback Dogs portfolio is up 113% since inception vs. +29% for the= S&P and Dow over the same time frame. 19 of Fried's last 22 trades have be= en profitable, with an average profit of 179%! Click Here for these Eight= Undervalued 'Best Buy' Stocks and your FREE 30-Day Subscription to The Buy= back Letter Why The Average Buyback Value Stock Outperforms The Market= By 45.3%: The New York Times reports that a study of all U.S. stocks fro= m 1980-1990 found that the stock of an average company announcing a repurc= hase plan will beat the market decisively (12.1% for the average company,= 45.3% for a value stock) in the four years following the repurchase annou= ncement. This makes sense. After all, when a company buys back their own s= tock, it's an enormous vote of confidence by those who know it best se= nior executives. No one else knows the firm's financial situation, market share, business plans, competitive advantages and new product strategies b= etter than those with hands-on, day-to-day experience. But, these executi= ves aren't talking. They keep their plans, tactics, and research behind cl= osed doors. The only indicator of their well-founded optimism is a stock buyback. It's a powerful indicator that no serious investor should ignore.= Just how powerful are buyback stocks? In the last 10 years if you had in= vested $10,000 in a typical S&P 500 portfolio, you investment would have g= rown to $67,917 an excellent return.

Our acquisition of Kiss.= com has been very successful adding significant critical mass and helping u= s become the 2nd largest business in the sector. Our growth this year has m= ade us a formidable contender for the number one slot during 2002. As our b= usiness model becomes more established it is our belief that the business w= ill reach an EBITDA to Revenue margin of around 50%."" ""Today we have around 175,000 paying subscribers, the market leader Match.c= om owned by Ticketmaster had approximately 250,000 subscribers at the end o= f September 2001. This year it is our understanding that uDate, Match and m= any of the other top 10 businesses in this sector have experienced good to strong growth in subscribers. The absence of any significant competitive pr= essures and the perception that the growth is accelerating in absolute term= s leads us to conclude that the market sector as a whole is growing at a si= gnificant rate. Our guidance figures indicate that our subscriber base will= be around 215,000 by December 31, 2001, 420,000 by December 2002 and 700,0= 00 by December 2003."" ""This is a sector where the size of subscriber base has significant impact on a company's ability to grow the business and achieve profitability. Many= companies who have entered this space have failed to achieve critical mass= and/or profitability. Examples include well financed start-ups like Social= Net who raised around $20M. Recently, Yahoo.com launched a subscription bas= ed personals service. However, in preparation for this Yahoo rejected adver= tising orders from competitive Online Personals services including uDate fr= om the early in July 2001. This has had little tangible impact on the growt= h of our business as advertising contracts were easily replaced with equal or better performing channels. The market should also recognize that Yahoo had been operating in this market sector for a long time offering a free se= rvice. Their move to a subscription based model was therefore welcomed."" ""There are a number of key factors driving growth in this sector including greater awareness of Online Personals and better understanding of what it i= s and is not; repeat users returning to Online Personals when a relationshi= p ends; greater critical mass of the top services leading to a more success= ful and compelling experience; greater acceptance of online subscription se= rvices; and improved use and availability of PC and digital camera technolo= gy. We believe the market has very significant potential for growth."" Morri= s concluded. Q3 Teleconference Those seeking to find out more about uDate.com, inc are invited to particip= ate in the company's forthcoming teleconference on Tuesday, October 30th at= 9.00AM EST, when Mel Morris, CEO and Martin Clifford Chief Operating Offic= er will be discussing the company's results for Quarter 3 2001 and the fore= casts through 2003.

susan.mara@enron.com,"ISO Press Conference $5.5 billion in refunds is wrong THE LA Times was wrong in its assertion that the ISO was asking for $5.5 billion in refunds. The filing is submitting comments to FERC. The ISO said that the purpose of the filing is to ask FERC to be more aggressive in their approach to market mitigation and provide context to FERC for its decision. The report the ISO staff has done covers the period from May 2000 to Feb 2001 and calculates that prices exceeded what they would expect in a competitive market by $6.2 billion. The ISO states that it is not claiming that these are overcharges. They understand that other factors are in play and that the ISO does not have access to the generator cost data so they are unable to say how much of the dollars are overcharges. ISO General Counsel said he can't tell how much is an overcharge, how much should be refunded, how much might be unjust and unreasonable. ISO is working with other state agencies, AG, CPUC, EOB, and don't know if the action should be taken at FERC, the courts, In the press conference, the news reporters are using the term ""gouging"" and the ISO is not using that term, but not necessarily correcting the reporters.

bucky.dusek@enron.com,"White Pine Generator Tom, I am an analyst with Metals Origination in London and got your name from David Oliver. Enron Metals is in the process of dealing with White Pine Copper Refinery in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. One of the options we are reviewing is returning a dormant generator to operation and selling the excess power. Natural gas is delivered to White Pine through an Enron pipeline. The generator can run on either natural gas or coal. Several years ago ('96 or '97), Enron contacted White Pine (previously owned by BHP Copper White Pine Refinery) on numerous occasions about running the powerhouse on gas and they would get the excess power to market. The idea at the time was they had excess natural gas and wanted White Pine to run the generators on gas. Would you know anything about this deal or who the originator was? If so, could you or the originator please contact me regarding the details. If not, could you please direct me to someone who may know about the original proposal?

I ordered it on-line before Thanksgiving and got it shortly thereafter. It's amazing how much information you can have at your fingertips! Two things that I've done with it so far is added my vehicle info to my Memo pad (maintenance records insurance info) to a category called CARS. (So the next time I take my car in for an oil change and they say, ""When was the last time you replaced your air filter,"" I'll be like, ""Well, funny that you ask because I've got that info right here."" Love that!! Also, I love the capability to have all of my health insurance info at my fingertips. I made a category on my Memo pad and included info like who my insurance is for dental, health, vision, plus my doctors names, numbers, etc... not to mention that I've got numbers, addresses, and email info for everyone. And that handy little calendar from Outlook that reminds me of stuff-all at my fingertips! I'm just learning about all the capabilities, but so far, I think IT'S FABULOUS! I'm telling everyone I know to get one! Thanks again! Angela P.

infopost@duke-energy.com,"TE Critical System Warning November 27, 2001 TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) continues to operate under the Critical System Warning issued November 26, 2001. Based on anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated below, Texas Eastern is requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt steps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts to actual deliveries. This system-wide warning is issued as a result of actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual deliveries. This Critical System Warning shall remain in place until further notice. Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation of the coming winter heating season. At this time, Texas Eastern's storage capacity is approximately 98% full. As a result, there is virtually no storage capacity or line pack available for system operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual imbalances left on the system. Due to the critical nature of this situation, and the fact that Texas Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system match actual customer takes in the market area. No due pipe gas will be accepted into the system until further notice. If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an operational flow order (""OFO"") requiring actual receipts of gas to match actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm. In addition, and as provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

cooper.richey@enron.com,"Re: Servers Administration While our webserver up here hasn't been hammered yet, I've been concerned about similar issues (web hardware and administration) for awhile up here. Given that the web is our primary medium I agree with you and Tim that it's been neglected. Administration is an ongoing issue and I'm not sure what a good solution for this is, but relying on Houston for this is not an option as far as I'm concerned (unless they change their draconian policies). At the moment Chris Wiebe is officially administrating our web/file server, but I don't think this is where his interests lie, so I've been relying on Colin for most day-to-day admin. This isn't great since Colin is a contractor. We should definitely team up on this one as I don't think IIS administration is even a quarter-time job, but it is vital. I'm in a similar spot on SQL Server issues Chris is the admin, but he's moving more toward the development side of IT with each passing week. In terms of hardware, I've been in touch with Houston through Dan Dietrich and spoke with a helpful individual who is responsible for web servers down there. He sent me the following documentation standard which I hope I forwarded onto you (as it's quite good). I'm pushing to move to the Houston standard for web servers which is two clustered pizza boxes (DL360s). I just got the price quote for these and it would be about 9000 US$ for the two boxes (basically dual proc PIII 930, 512 MB RAM, 2 9GB drives) You mentioned moving the dev environment from prod, but I'm not sure if you're interested in splitting the web from the file server. I think this is a good idea (more for file server reliability than anything else.) There's some time critical data up here that we can't recover if we miss it the first time, so I'm trying to make the backend as fault-tolerant as possible. plus, it seems like it's likely a cheap performance and fault tolerance boost for the web, as well. Sorry to hear about your web troubles yesterday, but hopefully it will serve as a catalyst for us to clean things up. Should we set up a call to talk about this?

peter.keohane@enron.com,"Ontario Master Project Elizabeth, in Mark's legal conference call this morning you updated your meeting in Toronto. Gaffney spoke to me last week after the meeting and his summary was in essence the same as yours. My thoughts which I passed along to Chris were: 1. I do not agree with OPGI's contention that the Ontario market will be financial only. I have crossed this issue a number of times in Ontario, and believe that this assertion is ill-conceived and would not be agreed to by those familiar with the developing market rules. Most notably, Aleck Dadson of the Government Affairs group in Toronto knows the market rules as they currently stand as well as any one in the market, and Rob Milnthorp is on the Board of the IMO. Both would, I believe, agree that there is a distinction as to how the IMO-controlled market will operate and physical bilateral OTC contracting. Operationally, the IMO-controlled market will be set up as a pool mechanism where physical bilats are permitted and indeed contemplated, but if there are deficiencies in physical delivery/receipt obligations those will be settled through the pool. This does not mean, however, that, in terms of legal obligations, there is not a physical delivery obligation and all that goes with it (such as force majeure, etc). Nor is the settlement in the pool costless to the non-defaulting party (prudential requirements, etc). To the extent that a party wants to rely on the pool to settle the deficiencies, and subject to issues such as compensating the non-defaulting party for any increased prudentials and other associated costs, there is still a physical bilat and the party with the delivery obligation can rely, if it chooses, on the contractula obligation to deliver ""or cause to be delivered"" the energy. In other words, I distinguish how the pool operates from the nature of the legal obligations. 2. I think the issue of force majeure needs to be reconsidered along the lines originally proposed by Greg. For pool level deliveries, whether in gas or in power, we (Canada) have always restricted force majeure to failure of the pool if it affects everyone transacting at the pool. This is the type of force majeure we use for ""NIT"" or ""Hub"" delivery obligations in gas, and is the type of force majeure Greg envisioned for the Alberta Power Pool and the IMO-Controlled Grid. This type of force majeure eliminates force majeure risk from our portfolio, as we therefore are never long or short as a result of force majeure. If we are transacting at a point outside of the pool, that will be the exception and not the rule, and should be dealt with specifically in the transaction Confirm. This is how we handle our gas business as set up by Lavorato. 3. Aleck Dadson should attend the next meeting (if not all meetings) with Chris to answer to any market rule issues. 4. Please involve Greg in your discusions on the form of Master that is developed. Peter.",0

rhihaga@aol.com,"(no subject) hey you! someone sent me this e-mail, and i thought of you. it's kind of long, but read it anyways ok-bye. maybe god wanted us to meet the wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift. maybe when the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us. maybe the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had. maybe it's true that we don't know what we have got until we lose it, but it is also true that we don't know what we have been missing until it arrives. giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they will love you back. don't expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their hearts; but if it does not, be content it grew in yours. it takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone. don't go for looks; they can deceive. don't go for wealth; even that fades away. go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. find the one that makes your heart smile. there are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real. dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you only have one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do. may you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human, enough hope to make you happy. always put yourself in other's shoes. if you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too. the happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way. happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have tried, for only that can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives. love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a tear. the brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches. when you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. live you life so that when you die, you are the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.

carol.st.@enron.com,"Collateral Issues Debbie and Tanya: I thought it might be helpful to summarize how certain of the collateral provisions in our trading agreements are impacted by the filing of bankruptcy: 1. ISDA Credit Support Annex Paragraph 4 provides that our counterparties do not have to post or release collateral to us if either an Event of Default, Potential Event of Default or Specified Condition has occurred or if an Early Termination Date has been designated for which an unsatisfied payment obligation exists. In addition, as you are aware, we can no longer hold cash or LC's, and as we discussed, since this language technically applies to LC's as well, it might be worth it to appoint a QI to hold our LC's for us. 2.

lorna.brennan@enron.com,"El Paso Articles Today-NGI Note: The following 3 articles deal with 3 different issues: 1st Marketing related 2nd Operations/marketing related 3rd Legislative/regulatory related El Paso Explosion Takes 500 MMcf/d Off Market About 1 Bcf/d of flow on El Paso's South Mainline downstream of Pecos River (NM) Station ceased after the pipeline exploded early Saturday, killing 10 people and seriously injuring two others at a nearby campsite. El Paso said Monday it was able to compensate for about half that volume through a combination of fuel switching by downstream customers, maximum storage withdrawals, an OFO and other customer cooperation. The market reaction was rather predictable as all three California points rose by about 35 cents to lead an overall price surge. However, utilities in the state did not appear to be experiencing any supply problems. SoCal Gas said storage and supplies from other Southwest receipt points were adequate to avoid any problems. A gas operations official for Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power also saw no reason for panic. From past similar incidents on Southwest pipelines, he expected that the approximately 80-feet-long section missing from El Paso's line could be ""slapped back into place rather quickly."" El Paso itself had no estimate for when it can restore service in the impacted segment; it must get approval rom the federal investigators before beginning repairs or evaluating a restart of the adjacent lines. But a large aggregator and a marketer agreed with the LADWP official that it should be ""a quick mechanical fix"" once repairs begin. The aggregator believed downtime could be as short as a week. No customers were cut off as a result of the rupture but some were getting reduced volumes, an El Paso spokeswoman said. Northern Natural Gas was seeing a throughput increase of 200-300 MMcf/d Monday while Transwestern volumes were up 50-75 MMcf/d as a result of shippers diverting gas away from El Paso's South Mainline, an Enron spokeswoman said. A producer said she diverted as much of her company's gas as possible from El Paso to Transwestern. People were reluctant to trade Permian Basin gas Monday, especially at fixed prices, because of doubts about how much would be able to flow, several sources said. Permian numbers rose a little less than 18 cents as part of the general upturn. However, it was Waha prices that saw a bigger increase of nearly 30 cents as a result. ""Everything in El Paso-Permian's Keystone pool was going back into Waha,"" said a marketer, putting Waha in the mid $4.60s at a premium of more than a nickel above Henry Hub. The Southern California border, at an average of nearly $5.30, led the rest of Monday's market by a large margin. Before trading began, EnronOnline was offering border swing swaps for the rest of the month at $5.85-95, a marketer said. With swing swaps priced so high, it gave sellers more confidence in what prices they could command in the day market, he said. ""Either way, I wouldn't want to be short right now at the border."" There were lots of rumors but no facts available on what caused the El Paso rupture, noted one aggregator. ""But it's a good thing it didn't happen until after California had cooled off. Otherwise I could easily have seen the border basis spread from San Juan Basin go as high as $2.50"" instead of the approximate gap of $1.70 egistered Monday by Daily GPI. A knowledgeable source provided his analyis of the blast: The structure of the crater made the rupture ""look like a line integrity problem from the way it blew out."" The earth can harbor leaking gas for a while until eventually everything all goes up at once. People nearby would not have detected anything because gas is odorless in long-haul lines; the mercaptan odorant is not added until it gets to the local distribution stage. Pipeline safety surveyors usually will look for dead vegetation in the vicinity to detect a leak, but this was a desert area with very little vegetation. It is easily possible for escaping gas to hug the ground for the approximate 500-foot distance to the victims' campsite and seek an ignition source there. It is a normal tendency for gas leaking into the atmosphere to stay close to the ground, and that tendency would have been amplied by the chilliness of the pre-dawn desert. The source went on to say, ""I think there will be lot more of this [ruptures] in the future with many pipes becoming at least 40-50 years old."" El Paso was unlucky in experiencing one of the early incidents, he said, because the situation applies to the other lines with old pipe. Pipelines used to spend a lot more money on maintenance when regulation was tighter and they were still paying for depreciation, he said. ""Now they're more purely for-profit companies after having written off their [depreciation] costs many times over."" _________________________________________________________ El Paso Blast Kills 10; Shuts Down South Mainline Federal and company investigators Monday swarmed over the scene of the devastating El Paso Natural Gas mainline explosion that erupted near daybreak Saturday, engulfing a party of weekend campers along the Pecos River near Carlsbad, NM, and killing 10 people. Two other persons were hospitalized in critical condition. Three officials from the federal Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) and 11 with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have been at the site of the blast since late Saturday, and two more OPS officials were en route Monday. New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, who flew to the area on Sunday, said he wanted to know how many other potential pipeline ""dangers"" there are in the state. He called for a thorough investigation. About 1 Bcf/d of capacity on El Paso's southern leg initially was lost from the ruptured 30-inch line and two looped lines nearby that were shut in after the accident. El Paso was making up some of the shortfall by drawing the maximum, 200 MMcf/d from its Washington Ranch Storage Field downstream of the accident. Increased use of other pipelines, allocations and cutbacks by customers, and the fact that weather had moderated in California helped ease the supply situation. Nevertheless, spot prices increased by about 35 cents for points in California, while the rest of the market (spurred by Hurricane Debby) went up about 20 cents. There was no estimate as to when the looped lines would be back in service, according to El Paso spokesperson Kim Wallace. ""We don't intend to put anything back into service until we know for certain that the remaining pipelines are safe,"" Wallace said. She did not expect them to be back in service today, and could give no time frame on when they would be returned to service. It is ""much too premature at this point"" to predict when the three disabled El Paso westbound lines will return to service, said Patricia Klinger, a spokeswoman with the Department of Transportation's Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), which oversees the OPS. ""The one that ruptured is definitely going to be out of service for awhile, and [another line] is badly damaged from the fire."" As for a third adjacent line, that ""could potentially be re-opened,"" but ""we have to test the integrity of that line"" and have it examined by metallurgists, she told Daily GPI. ""Everyone will be working, of course, to try to get this [line] back in service. But the safe operation of the pipeline is of premiere importance."" The three lines shared the same right-of-way. ""We're just now able to start looking at exactly what happened, and how to get that one line back in service,"" Klinger said. ""Our metallurgist is on his way right now. I know he's going to meet with the NTSB when they're examining the 50-foot section of pipe that's out of the ground"" as a result of the explosion. ""I think the company also wants to decide what types of tests can be done on this line. It's not piggable."" The NTSB, which has set up a command center in Carlsbad, NM, declined to make any preliminary speculation about the cause of the explosion. ""It's much too early for us to even think about the cause of this accident. We're only dealing with the facts...Right now, we're documenting the pipe itself and surveying the land. We're going to look at the chronology of when the [emergency] calls came in..... document damage to vehicles, and injuries,"" said NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway. ""Probably at this point we're looking at nine months to a year, maybe more"" before the results of the investigation are publicly disclosed, Holloway noted. The rupture occurred at 5:30 a.m. MDT in the underground line near the Pecos River crossing, which is about 30 miles south of the Carlsbad Caverns National Park in a spot popular with local campers and fishermen. The blast tore a crater in the earth about 86 feet long, 46 feet wide and 20 feet deep. According to preliminary reports, the pipeline was underground at the point of rupture, sending two sections of pipe, each about 20-feet long, flying hundreds of feet. The gas then ignited and shot flames from the broken pipe toward sleeping campers. The NTSB estimated there was a gap of 50 to 60 feet between broken ends of the pipeline at the site. The fire burned for about 40 minutes before El Paso workers manually shut off pipeline valves. Ten members of two families were burned to death in the blast. The families, who were related by marriage, were camping on public land along the river near where the pipeline emerged from the ground to cross the Pecos in an aerial crossing alongside a bridge. Six were pronounced dead at the scene and four others died at Texas hospitals Saturday night. The dead included five children under the age of six, including six-month-old twins. Two adults were listed in critical condition Monday at a hospital in Lubbock, TX. The ruptured pipeline, which El Paso said was constructed in 1950, is one of four that runs along the southern branch of El Paso's pipeline system. There is an adjacent 30-inch pipeline and another 26-inch pipeline. The fourth, a 16-inch pipeline, was abandoned and is not available for service, Wallace said. El Paso and federal officials are particularly interested in the integrity of the second 30-inch pipeline that ran close to the broken line. Wallace said that none of the company's customers had been cut off of service, but they were receiving gas as reduced levels. She also said that on Aug. 2, a ""patrol"" inspection, either done by air or vehicle, was conducted on the pipelines located near the Pecos River by El Paso officials and no problems were found. El Paso conducted the last corrosion test in February and no problems were found then either. Visual inspections are conducted on all of the system's pipelines once a month, she said, and the company follows all federal pipeline requirements for inspections. Asked whether El Paso planned to change its inspection system immediately, Wallace said that she did not think so, but said that if the NTSB review finds something that needs to be changed, the company will do whatever needs to be done immediately. ""These situations are so rare,"" she said. ""We don't feel that we need to change what we're doing now. But if the situation warrants, we certainly will make any changes necessary."" El Paso is working with family members to take care of their immediate needs, including hotel accommodations, food, travel arrangements and medical treatment. The company also is providing additional services as needed. ""This is a tragic accident and our heartfelt condolences go out to the families involved,"" said El Paso Energy President William Wise. He said the company was working with the NTSB ""to investigate diligently all matters surrounding this accident and to establish its cause as quickly as possible."" The fallout of the explosion is expected to extend all across the country, as federal legislators consider more stringent pipeline rules following an explosion in Bellingham, WA, that killed three in June 1999. Locally, Carlsbad Mayor Gary Perkowski said that he wanted to find out what happened and keep it from ever happening again. That reaction was echoed by the New Mexico governor. ""I have a lot of questions,"" said Johnson. ""What is the reliability of these pipelines? What went wrong? Was it preventable?"" Meanwhile, RSPA was sifting through its history to determine whether the El Paso blast was the biggest pipeline disaster on record in terms of fatalities. Timeline: 5:26 a.m. Aug. 19: El Paso Natural Gas' automated computer reading of the pressure in the pipeline indicates 673.5 pounds per square inch. Around 5:30 a.m.: An El Paso Natural Gas employee bow-hunting in the area sees a large fireball at the scene. 5:30 a.m.: El Paso Natural Gas' automated computer reading of the pressure in the pipeline drops to 377.19 pounds per square inch. 5:30 a.m.: Carlsbad Fire Department responds to the emergency. 6:12 a.m.: Carlsbad Fire Department arrives at the scene. 6:21 a.m.: El Paso Natural Gas workers shut off the gas line using manual valves. Between Jan. 1 and June 30 of this year, there have been 40 transmission pipeline incidents, according to the OPS. Fourteen were caused by either external or internal corrosion; 11 were damaged by outside forces; three were due to construction or material defects; and 10 were unknown. There was only one fatality until June 30 of this year on transmission pipeline incidents, which was caused by an outside force. Eleven people had been injured through June. In August 1999, OPS sent a warning letter to El Paso, citing it for a number of pipeline safety violations in Arizona. The OPS did not impose a civil fine on El Paso, but it advised the pipeline that ""should you not correct the circumstances leading to the violation, we will take enforcement actions when and if the continued violation comes to our attention."" -- El Paso Blast May Cinch Tough Pipe Safety Bill The explosion on El Paso Natural Gas' system, which killed 10 people over the weekend, may give Congress the added boost to pass a tough pipeline safety reauthorization bill when it returns from recess in September, Capitol Hill insiders said Monday. ""This just sadly proves why Congress needs to act as soon as it returns [on Sept. 5] to pass the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act before any more innocent lives are taken,"" said a spokeswoman for Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). In June, Chairman McCain's Senate Commerce Committee voted out the Pipeline Safety Improvement bill that would, among other things, give states inspection and oversight authority over interstate pipelines; require interstate pipelines to consult with states about their integrity plans; create stiffer penalties for pipeline safety transgressors; and offer protection to whistle-blowers who report pipeline violations. McCain proposed the agressive safety bill following the product pipeline explosion in Bellingham, WA, that killed three in June 1999. ""McCain has always been determined to pass this bill this year, but this obviously sadly strengthens that resolve,"" she said. He ""will make a determined effort for this to happen,"" but whether it's brought up for a vote on the Senate floor will be up to Senate Leader Trent Lott (R-MS), the McCain spokeswoman said. ""I have no doubts"" that the Senate will push for pipeline safety when it returns, said Terry Boss, vice president of environment, safety and operations for the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA). On the House side, a companion to McCain's bill has been introduced, as well as a number of other pipeline safety measures, but most are at the subcommittee level. But the issue could pick up steam in the wake of the El Paso blast. ""We must examine why this accident occurred and ensure that it must never happen again,"" said Rep. Joe Skeen (R-NM). ""Definitely it's a tragic situation,"" Boss said, referring to the explosion near Carlsbad, NM, which reportedly left a crater about 20 feet deep, 46 feet wide and 86 feet long. Five of the 10 fatalities were children, who were spending a weekend camping and fishing with their family along the Pecos River. The political fallout from the disaster was being assessed in Washington D.C. yesterday. ""Any kind of incident has political ramifications.....We're just not sure how this is going to 'directly impact'"" pending legislation and regulations, Boss noted. ",0

The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2. **Brett Favre** ](<URL>) QB GB Frank Updated 10/24/01 Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight. **Marvin Minnis** ](<URL>) WR KC Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup. But the _Kansas City Star_ notes Chris Thomas is still working with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on Thursday against the Colts. **Larry Foster** ](<URL>) WR DET Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 According to the _Detroit Free Press_ Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks. **Marcus Robinson** ](<URL>) WR CHI Hunter Updated 10/24/01 The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league. **Neil Rackers** ](<URL>) K CIN Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 According to the _Cincinnati Enquirer_ the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play. **Todd Pinkston** ](<URL>) WR PHI Hunter Updated 10/24/01 Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis. **Ron Dixon** ](<URL>) WR NYG Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week. **Joe Jurevicius** ](<URL>) WR NYG Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines. **Reggie Swinton** ](<URL>) WR DAL Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence. **Joey Galloway** ](<URL>) WR DAL Giggles Updated 10/24/01 Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo. **Darrin Chiaverini** ](<URL>) WR DAL Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury. **Raghib Ismail** ](<URL>) WR DAL Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game. **Ricky Watters** ](<URL>) RB SEA Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According to the _Tacoma News Tribune_ Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch. **Trent Dilfer** ](<URL>) QB SEA Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. **Matt Hasselbeck** ](<URL>) QB SEA Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the _Seattle Post-Intelligencer_ He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. **Wayne Chrebet** ](<URL>) WR NYJ JWillie Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams. **Dedric Ward** ](<URL>) WR MIA Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season. **Lamar Smith** ](<URL>) RB MIA Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week. **Marvin Minnis** ](<URL>) WR KC Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week. **Jerome Pathon** ](<URL>) WR IND Tori Updated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week. **Terrence Wilkins** ](<URL>) WR IND Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week. **Terrell Davis** ](<URL>) RB DEN JWillie Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.

By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D Pacific Gas Electric Co. (PG&E), in filings with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO), has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases in the state. The utility is asking the CPUC to lower the current rate cap from $250 per megawatt hour to $100, or 10 cents per kilowatt hour. In seeking the rate cap, PG&E is joined by Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, and The Utility Action Network (TURN= a ratepayer advocacy group. ANALYSIS: The current rate cap of $250 per megawatt hour in the wholesale market of California resulted from the price spikes experienced in San Diego this summer. As San Diego Gas Electric had paid off its stranded costs, the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and SDG&E customers were exposed to market-based prices, which doubled and at times tripled due to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns. PG&E custom= ers were not exposed to the price spikes because, at the time, PG&E had not paid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze. Yet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same. PG&E buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market, and as a resul= t is about $2.2 billion in debt (some figures suggest it is as high as $2.7 billion). Due to the retail rate freeze still in effect, PG&E has been unable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates. In real terms, PG&E was paying up to 19 cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale market this summer, when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers on average 5 cents per kilowatt hour. In total, PG&E has paid about $2.7 billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for, and this amount is growing by hundreds of millions each month. This explains the utility's motivation in wanting to see the CPUC further lower the cap on wholesale rates in California. However, even though PG&E as a whole is in debt, the utility=01*as well as other divisions under parent company PG&E Corp.=01*is still making money of= f deregulation in California. For instance, PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear plant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesa= le market. The utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities= =01* the ones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power assets=01*still provide about $150 million a month to the utility. In addit= ion, PG&E Corp.'s unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing very well. And the unregulated National Energy Group=01*which operates in markets outside of California, such as Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire=01*posted a 233-percent profit increase for the second quarte= r. Thus, it is important to note the distinction between PG&E and its parent, PG&E Corp. Ironically, as a whole, PG&E Corp. has stated that it does not support rate caps, and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other states. PG&E reported second-quarter earnings of $216 million on $2.3 billion in revenue, representing a 26-percent increase over the same quarter last year. Third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong. This puts PG&E in an awkward predicament. On one hand, PG&E wants to convince=20 shareholders that the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that it sells. On the other hand, PG&E is attempting to convince regulators that it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay for power. In fairness, though, the revenue PG&E has earned cannot come anywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due to its obligation of serving customers. PG&E's rate freeze is scheduled to end March 31, 2002, at the very latest, or sooner if it is determined that PG&E's stranded costs have been repaid, something that utility executives say may already have taken place. Due to higher-than-expected revenues and higher-than-market valuations of the utility's assets, it may very well be the case that PG&E's stranded costs are already paid off. When this is officially determined by the CPUC, PG&E will argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt it has assumed while the rate caps were in place. The CPUC has scheduled a hearing to address these issues on Oct. 19. The core question of these proceedings will be whether or not PG&E should be allowed to turn over its debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted= PG&E wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt, based on the date which the CPUC determines that PG&E had in fact paid off its stranded costs, a point groups such as TURN will surely protest. It may seem surprising that TURN was among the group with PG&E that filed the petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices. Typically, TURN and PG&E (along with most utilities) are at polar opposites regarding most issues. However, both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want to see a new cap put into place, but for completely different reasons. TURN says that PG&E and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the rate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted from that risk onto customers. TURN continues to retain a watch over the proceedings related to PG&E's proposal, specifically with regard to the possibility that the CPUC will allow the utility to raise rates on customer= s. Within the course of these new developments, it's important to be clear on PG&E's motivations. Some California lawmakers and consumer advocates have called for a complete return to regulation, arguing that deregulation in California has become a failed experiment. Many have surmised that PG&E'= s proposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return California to a regulated structure. I think this is a misinterpretation. PG&E has very clearly stated that its proposal is a ""necessary short-term step to try to bring prices back in line."" PG&E's efforts really shouldn't be viewe= d as a move to return California to a regulated market. Rather, PG&E is merel= y attempting to protect its own interests. The utility wants to secure tempor= ary lower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and trans= fer its debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted. A return to regulati= on via a permanent rate cap would not be in PG&E's best interests as it contin= ues to sell power from its nuclear plant. In addition, PG&E probably recognizes that regulation would discourage additional companies from building new power plants in California, which would not be good for the long-term econo= my of the state. This also would do little to lower wholesale prices in=20 California. As we discovered this summer, the less supply, the higher the price for power. PG&E's proposal to lower rate caps on wholesale prices is, more than anythi= ng else, an attempt to protect itself from what it perceives as disastrous economic impact if it is not able to transfer its debt to customers. A recent Wall Street Journal report inferred that if wholesale prices continu= e to exceed what PG&E can charge customers, the utility could become=20 ""technically insolvent"" sometime next year. It will be interesting to see if the CPUC has the same perception when it evaluates PG&E's proposal later this month. =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D Need to design and implement your IT infrastructure?

The rest of the group will continue to manage their cash index points for the next day trading, while adding the BOM physical with a basis link to Monique's GD BOM products. I would like to get the cash products out on eol by 7:15 each morning. The early info will come in handy as we approach winter. Let me know what you think.

kevin.hyatt@enron.com,"TW Bullets 2/9 Capacity Marketing We negotiated an extension of the 400,000 MMBtu/d east-to-east contract with Aquila USGT this week plus improved the economics of their existing contract. The extension, beginning November 2001, has a reservation rate of $.025/MMBtu with a 30% sharing of the Permian to Cal Border index spreads on all alternate westward flow. As for their existing contract, we negotiated a $.15/MMBtu rate effective February 15 October 31, 2001 on the alternate west flow, an improvement of $.11/MMBtu. In addition, we negotiated a similar east deal with alternate west flow with Astra Power LLC. Their reservation rate is $.0325/MMBtu on a volume of 50,000/d for a term of March 2001 through March 2003. With the execution of these two deals plus the anticipated closing of the Public Service of New Mexico contract, this will effectively sell out the east end of the TW system through at least 2002. San Juan Flow Conditioner The decision was made this week to postpone till March the application of the Exxon/Nalco flow conditioner in the San Juan lateral. Had we proceeded with the application in February (a tariff month), the minimum lost revenue impact for one day could have been $300,000. SouthWest Gas We received the fully executed OBA contract from SouthWest Gas this week. Gas Inventory With moderating temperatures out west reducing demand and shippers paying gas back to TW, we were experiencing high linepack for most of the week. TW was able to sell 55,000 MMBtu at the border for a net revenue of $453,000. Reliant We negotiated a San Juan Pool contract for 20,000 MMBtu/d at max rates for February 6-28. Reliant is flowing alternate out of path from San Juan to the border and scheduling 5,000 to 12,000 MMBtu/d. Incremental revenue for this could range from $42,000 to $100,000 for the month.",1

david.forster@enron.com,"Conflict with AEP/CP&L over Tex-Mex Presidential Permit No action needed on your part, but just in case you hear something through the grapevine, here is current situation: Summary AEP/CP&L have economic interests in the Brownsville area which are best served if we do not locate our tie in Brownsville Public Utility Board's (BPUB's) service territory and BPUB does not obtain the system upgrades which would be justified by our tie. AEP is trying to stall our Presidential Permit Application and to coerce us into moving the tie onto their system. BPUB sees this as an attack on their interests and is planning to challenge AEP. 5 MOU's have been signed with customers and discussions are continuing with 12 others, who have all been met and have expressed interest. We are optimistic that the PP will be issued and standard Ercot treatments will prevail, but we will likely be delayed to sometime early next year. History Enron filed Presidential Permit (PP) Application CP&L (owned by AEP) intervened against the application and raised some technical issues DOE asked Enron and CP&L/AEP to meet and resolve issues Meeting occurred between Enron and CP&L/AEP. General technical solutions were identified, with specific solutions to be determined through a SPS study. Enron drafted a letter outlining the points covered in our meeting with CP&L/AEP, intending to have the letter signed by both of us and forwarded to DOE, requesting that DOE proceed with issuing the PP. AP&L/AEP refused to sign the letter and are now arguing that an SPS scheme is not sufficient for the proposed tie location (although AEP operates under SPS elsewhere within Ercot, they argue that ours is a special case. Independent opinion (and our own) is that there is little merit to the CP&L/AEP position). AEP have told us that if we move the tie to a location West of Brownsville (on AEP's proposed line expansion), that they would drop all opposition. AEP/CP&L have since approached the Ercot Board arguing that cost studies should be done on alternate tie locations and the system cost impact thereof. AEP/CP&L have submitted to the Ercot Board that Enron should be responsible for any costs associated building the tie at anything other than the least-cost (system perspective) location. Current Status Brownsville (BPUB) are incensed at AEP/CP&L's behaviour and are planning the following actions: Making submission to Ercot that: BPUB informed Ercot of the project 14 months ago and no further studies or committee reviews by Ercot should be necessary. No changes to current Ercot procedures should be contemplated and the tie should be viewed as a firm, native BPUB load BPUB lawyer is drafting letter to go to AEP demanding that AEP honor their previous agreement with BPUB to be supportive of BPUB projects. BPUB CEO, engineer and lawyer will visit PUC-T next week to make the case that no special arrangements should be made with regard to Enron or BPUB needing to pick up additional system costs At this point, BPUB is highly motivated and is striking out with an aggressive representation of their position as there are implications for them which go beyond the current project. Furthermore, there is little love lost between BPUB and AEP. Although moving to the AEP-proposed location would remove AEP as an obstacle, we would lose the work done to date preparing with BPUB and would probably make an enemy of BPUB. Bob Franks (regulatory), Scott Laidlaw (engineering/technical) and myself are coordinating with Bracewell Patterson (regulatory advisors) on Enron's strategy and level of support for BPUB.",1

lorna.brennan@enron.com,"PG&E and SoCal on Negative Watch Note: FYI Fitch Puts 2 CA Utilities on Negative Watch In the midst of the continuing uncertainty over regulatory treatment of growing wholesale electricity cost under-collections, Fitch Tuesday assigned a ""rating watch negative"" designation to the securities of California's two largest investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison (and its parent company, Edison International). In addition, it lowered Edison's commercial paper rating one notch to ""F1"" from ""F1+"". Fitch cited the need for ""significant and extensive regulatory decisions"" to resolve the continuing problem of retail utility electric rate under-collections plaguing both utilities. It indicated that with the ""watch negative"" status, the independent rating service expects to review the ratings within six months. A spokesperson for PG&E Corp., the parent of Pacific Gas and Electric, said the Fitch move doesn't lower any of its ratings, but it ""underscores the seriousness of the situation (in California) and the need for all the parties to come together for a collaborative solution."" The companies have asked for relief from the California Public Utilities Commission (see Daily GPI, Oct. 30). Edison is the target of an investors' lawsuit which accuses it of illegally booking as revenue the wholesale power costs that have yet to be collected. (see Daily GPI, Nov. 1). The Fitch move had no effect on PG&E's latest utility debt line extension of $1.3 billion that was implemented recently in response to the continuing under-collections, the spokesperson said. Fitch reiterated that through September the two utilities had booked under-collections exceeding $5 billion collectively and that wholesale power prices continue to exceed the utilities' frozen retail rate levels. ""While these amounts exceed immediate funding requirements, their recovery through rates is uncertain,"" Fitch stated in its announcement on the negative watch. ""Barring a change in regulatory policy, PG&E and SoCal Edison anticipate they will be unable to recover their under-collections before the end of the statutory rate freeze period ending March 31, 2002. --",1

QUALCOMM Announces New Financial Segment Reporting SAN= DIEGO, Jan 17, 2002 (BUSINESS WIRE) QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM= today provided access to historical data in its new financial segment re= porting format. The new reporting includes two new segments, called QUALCOM= M Wireless Internet and QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives, which were create= d as a result of certain changes in the Company's businesses and managerial= reporting as announced in July 2001. Effective in the first quarter of fis= cal 2002, the Company's complete financial segment reporting includes: QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT) develops and supplies industr= y-leading CDMA chipset and system software solutions used in networ= k infrastructure equipment, phones and other wireless devices. QCT integrates industry-leading capabilities into its chipsets; includi= ng radioOne(TM) direct conversion technology and gpsOne(TM) wireles= s position location technology facilitated by SnapTrack(TM), a whol= ly owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM. QUALCOMM Technology Licens= ing (QTL) licenses the Company's essential CDMA patent portfolio= to telecom equipment and consumer electronics manufacturers worldw= ide. To date, QUALCOMM has licensed over 100 companies to use its p= ortfolio of over 1,900 U.S. patents and patent applications applica= ble to CDMA and other technologies. QUALCOMM Wireless Int= ernet (QWI) comprised of the following businesses: Q= UALCOMM Internet Services (QIS) formed to accelerate the dev= elopment of applications for the wireless Internet, building on= QUALCOMM's Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless(TM) (BREW(T= M)) applications platform. The BREW platform enables hardware m= anufacturers and software developers to quickly create new prod= ucts and applications, and allows users to download and run tho= se applications on their wireless devices. QUALCOMM= Digital Media (QDM) develops technologies to support the pr= ocessing, transmission and management of content for a variety of media applications, including the delivery of digitized moti= on pictures (Digital Cinema) and highly secure, wireless produc= ts for the U.S. government. QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solution= s (QWBS) develops and provides satellite and terrestrial-bas= ed fleet management solutions to over 400,000 vehicles in 32 countries. The QWBS Network Management Center processes more than seven million transactions per day, making it one of the largest wireless data networks in the world. QUALCOMM Strate= gic Initiatives (QSI) formed to consolidate and manage the Compa= ny's strategic investment activities. QUALCOMM invests in wireless carriers and manufacturers to promote the worldwide adoption of CDM= A products and services for wireless voice and Internet data applic= ations. Generally, the Company will exit these investments at the e= arliest possible time, provided the individual circumstances of a particular investment permit an orderly exit without undermi= ning QUALCOMM's original strategic purpose. Earnings or losses from= the QSI segment come from interest income, increases or decreases in the value of investments (both realized and unrealized) and QUAL= COMM's share of income or losses from consolidated subsidiaries and= investments accounted under the equity method of accounting. From time-to-time other income may result from strategic activities such as the sale of an FCC bidding credit in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001. QUALCOMM is providing new information on the QSI segment to aid investors' understanding of the investments that the Company has mad= e and the income or losses generated from those investments. QUALCOMM will separate the financial performance of QSI from its core operating businesse= s because many of these investments are in development-stage companies incu= rring planned accounting losses that are consolidated into QUALCOMM's repor= ted earnings. The Company believes that the new financial segment reporting= will allow investors to more accurately value the different elements of QU= ALCOMM's activities. Under the new financial segment reporting, net earning= s of $0.10 per share for fiscal 2001 and $0.09 per share for fiscal 2000 ha= ve been moved from core operations into the QSI segment. Historical infor= mation, including revenues and earnings before taxes by segment, is present= ed on QUALCOMM's Investor Relations web site at <URL> QUALCOMM will report the results of its first fiscal quarter of 2002 using this new reporting format on January 24, 2002. QUALCOMM Incorporated (<URL> .com) is a leader in developing and delivering innovative digital wireless communications products and services based on the Company's CDMA digital te= chnology. The Company's business areas include CDMA chipsets and system sof= tware; technology licensing; wireless fleet management systems, OmniTRACS(R= TruckMAIL(TM), OmniExpress(R), LINQ(TM); BREW(TM) applications platform;= and satellite-based systems including portions of the Globalstar(TM) syste= m. QUALCOMM owns patents that are essential to all of the CDMA wireless tel= ecommunications standards that have been adopted or proposed for adoption b= y standards-setting bodies worldwide. QUALCOMM has licensed its essential C= DMA patent portfolio to more than 100 telecommunications equipment manufact= urers worldwide. Headquartered in San Diego, Calif., QUALCOMM is included i= n the S?500 Index and is a 2001 FORTUNE 500(R) company traded on The Nasdaq= Stock Market(R) under the ticker symbol QCOM.

For one week only, Job Master, normally $2,495.00, is on sale for a total price of $1,495.00. In order for you to receive this $1,000.00 savings we must have your order by October 31. (To reply by E Mail to this message or be removed from our list, Please go to the bottom of this message for an E Mail link.) Job Master is designed specifically for small to medium sized manufacturers, and costs many thousands of dollars less than any other even remotely comparable software package. Following is a list of features. If you have any questions, would like to discuss the package further, or if you would like to obtain our Web site address for a total walk through of the program, please call me directly at (661) 286-0041. By way of background, we are a software company, which for some years has specialized in the development of custom software, primarily for small to medium sized manufacturers. Job Master is a distillation of over a million and a half dollars of software we have developed to control and manage the production of our manufacturing clients. Job Master contains the following features: 1. QUOTATION MODULE. In this module, quotes are developed, modified, and produced for sending to your client. A history is kept of all quotes for future reference, or modification for other clients. All quotations and revisions are ""auto numbered,"" including versions. The quotes section allows for the entry of parts/processes, and costing of each, including materials, labor, markup, and taxes. Inventory status can be accessed from this section for reference. 2. SALES ORDER. Once a quotation is accepted, the final quotation information can be transformed into a Sales Order for your client's signature on a ""point and click"" basis. The Sales Order can be modified and re issued if necessary. A history if kept of all Sales Orders for future reference, or modification for other clients. All sales orders and revisions are ""auto numbered,"" including versions. Inventory status can be accessed from this section for reference. 3. CUSTOMER LETTERS can be created from the Quotation and Sales Order sections. 4. SHOP TRAVELER/WORK ORDER. Once a Sales Order is accepted, the sales order information can be transformed into a shop traveler/work order on a ""point and click"" basis. Each item on the Sales Order becomes a shop traveler/work order, with each step of production of the item then listed on the traveler/work order. Each such traveler/work order is tied back into the Sales Order. The shop traveler/work order allows for the entry of line items, and notes on each line item. The shop traveler/work order contains a ""notes"" section. The Shop traveler/work order allows for the storing or attachment of drawings to the traveler/work order. The shop traveler/work order also contains a ""drop down,"" from which standard processes can be selected for inclusion on the shop traveler/work order. The shop traveler/work order numbers progress in order of production sequence, and re numbers them if new steps are added. The shop traveler/work order allows for change orders or revisions, a! nd numbers changes in sequence of the original shop traveler/work order number; i.e., 100, 100-1, 100-2, etc. All shop traveler/work orders and related revisions are retained in memory for future reference. The shop traveler/work order is bar coded for tracking of production step by step, and production of ongoing client status reports. Bar coding includes the ability for an employee to ""swipe"" their own ID bar code for recording in the system as to who upgraded what step. The shop traveler/work order function also allows for manual update of production status. The shop traveler/work order allows for quality control sign off, and the final production of certifications, either from a ""canned"" list, or hand typed in on a case by case basis. 5. INVENTORY. The application includes an inventory section, which allows operations to check materials inventory in and out. The inventory section allows for the comparison of inventory received against a P.O., and produces an ""overage/underage"" report of inventory received as compared against the P.O. The inventory section allows for the setting of minimum (re-order now!) and maximum inventory amounts, and produces reports showing what inventory needs to be ordered, as well as inventory that is at or above the maximum set to have in house. The inventory section also tracks ""partially shipped"" orders, which are tied in to the shipping function. This section shows how much completed product under a particular order has been actually shipped to a client, and how much remains to be shipped. The balance is adjusted as shipments are made. 6. REQUEST FOR PURCHASE. The application allows operators to produce a Request For Purchase for accounting for any inventory items, which need to be ordered. Inventory items have a drop down of approved vendors for each item. 7. REQUEST FOR BID. The application allows operators to produce a Request For Bid for accounting to send to Vendors for any inventory items, which need to be ordered. Inventory items have a drop down of approved vendors for each item to which Requests For Bid can be sent. 8. INVOICE.

lippmanc@aol.com,"CALIFORNIA 2nd QUARTER PRODUCTION REPORT Lippman Consulting, Inc. is pleased to announce that it has just completed the 2nd quarterly of 2001 gas production report for the state of California. This report contains text and graphs depicting various historical statistics. The total California production volumes are separated by associated and non-associated volumes. The report also separates production by state and federal areas as well as onshore and offshore volumes. For the onshore volumes, we detail the production down to the district level while for the offshore volumes, we detail those down to the field level. In addition to showing historical production volumes in various categories, the report also provides the reader with monthly net gas storage injection and withdrawal volumes along with the total gas volumes in storage for the state. Working gas as well as cushion gas levels are also reported. California is a major consuming district and the level of production contained within the state has a direct bearing on the amount of gas imports that will be needed to satisfy demand. The cost for this report is $300 on a quarterly subscription basis or the report can be purchased on a one time basis for $450.

The plan, pending regulatory approval, aims to build at least one 500 MW combined cycle natural gas-fired unit and at least two 600 MW coal-fired units over the next decade, for a total of 1,700 MW. More units may be built after 2010, eventually raising new generation capacity in the state to around 3,000 MW. Wisconsin Public Service also hopes to add to the state's power grid by building the Arrowhead-Weston line, a 250-mile 345 kilovolt transmission line from Minnesota to central Wisconsin. The line would directly link Wisconsin to power supplies in Canada and North Dakota, easing transmission bottlenecks to the west and south. Wisconsin imports up to 20% of its power. [IMAGE] Natural?

Customer demand under new 10-year wholesale power contracts with the BPA is so strong that the agency must purchase power on the open market to augment its supply. To recover the cost of these purchases, it proposes to tack a 15% charge onto wholesale rates effective next October. Even with an additional charge, BPA's wholesale rates are still well below wholesale market prices currently forecast for the next five years on the West Coast. BPA signed new wholesale contracts last week with more than 130 Northwest utilities and industries for 10-years. Those agreements pushed its total firm energy load? up to 11,000 MW. That is almost 3000 MW more than the federal Columbia River Power System can generate on a firm basis.

susan.mara@enron.com,"ISO Report on Overcharging Market Power I exchanged v-mails with Elena Scmid at the ISO. The leaked information pertains to a filing to be made at FERC today that responds to the FERC Staff's report on market mitigation. The ISO had last week released its own proposed market mitigation plan or, as they referred to it, the market stabilization plan. There was much negative response to it. I spoke against it at the Board meeting and submitted written comments in opposition. The Board blessed it ""in concept"" and agreed to the let the staff file it, but to ask the staff for a few changes. I would be surprised if much has changed since we've seen it. Along with the filing are two staff reports, one by Angeli and one by Eric Hildebrandt that identifyy what they see as market power. According the Elena, she does not believe that the reports use the term ""gouging."" These reports are just extenstions of what we've seen from the ISO before. Previously, the ISO talked about $650 million or so in potential refunds. These reports extend the time period of the analysis. I've asked Elena to let me know if Enron is named and when it will be posted. Elena says that the ISO also asks for the mitigation period to be at all times not just at 5% of the time as FERC has sugested. It is not yet posted on the ISO web site. The ISO is holding press conference now and I'm listening in. Sue Mara Enron Corp. Tel: (415) 782-7802 Fax:(415) 782-7854",1

alan.comnes@enron.com," <URL> Return to regular view Federal price limits backfire Some generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, July 4, 2001 ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: <URL> Officials in California and Nevada, after months of lobbying for federal regulators to cap Western power prices, warned yesterday that the newly imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of blackouts in the two states. The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling blackouts yesterday afternoon, and one day after the first-ever rolling blackouts in Las Vegas forced energy-hungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduce air conditioning. The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take a closer look at the so-called price mitigation plan and come up with revisions that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during shortages. ""We need some clarity to this order,"" said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the California Department of Water Resources, which is spending billions of dollars to keep the state's lights on. ""Generators need to be held accountable,"" he said. The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages, yet power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below-market rates during periods of high demand. Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the expense of shipping electricity from state to state. Each mile that electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost. ""No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps,"" said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an energy-industry association in Menlo Park. Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price controls are in effect. ""This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up not having enough,"" Ackerman said. ""It increases the threat of blackouts."" BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED California authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert about an hour later, after finding additional supplies. ""Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts,"" said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power network. The Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their lights. Don Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said that the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in exacerbating Monday's shortage. ""We're looking very closely at this,"" he said. ""There seems to be a potential for unintended consequences."" Specifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less- efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishing, under capped prices. ""We're going to see how the caps might have played into this,"" he said. The federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $92 per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because of the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101. Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls have extended California's power crisis to neighboring states. ""California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus,"" he said. 'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES' California and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith that price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot withhold output. ""The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan),"" said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources. Unfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue that they took up only with the greatest reluctance. For months, federal regulators refused to impose price controls, preferring instead to let supply and demand determine costs. Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling back on output Monday, California officials immediately dialed the hot line number provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emergencies. ""No one answered,"" he said. ""They were closed."" State officials tried again yesterday, and this time were told that the commission would look into the matter. They were not given a time frame for when the commission might come up with a response. E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page A 1 ",1

truorange@aol.com,"True Orange, Oct. 9, 2000, Part 1 Jerry Scarbrough's True Orange The Internet Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume 10, No. 26, October 9, 2000 No What-Iffing in This One =01) Sooners Turn Longhorns Every Which Way but Loose The Longhorns had their worst day during the Mack Brown era Saturday in Dallas and they picked a bad time to do it because unbeaten Oklahoma scored on its first six possessions, and, for good measure, ran a pass back for a touchdown, too, en route to a 63-14 victory. The Sooners dominated the Longhorns offensively, defensively and on special teams. They even won the halftime, when a Billy Sims-led relay team beat an Eric Metcalf-led relay team. QB Josh Huepel passed the Longhorns to death and 5-7, 193-pound sophomore R= B Quentin Griffin broke Oklahoma's school scoring record =01) and Longhorn fa= ns' hearts =01) with six touchdowns. In short, it just wasn't a good day to be a Texas fan =01) in the cold, dam= p Cotton Bowl or anywhere. The loss dropped Texas to 4-2 for the season and 1-1 in the Big 12 and gave the Sooners a big boost in their drive toward national and Big 12 honors. It also made this Saturday's game with Colorado in Boulder the biggest game of the year. This is a season on the brink. It could go up or down. Remembe= r that 66-3 debacle with UCLA that started the slide in John Mackovic's last year? Brown is made of sterner stuff and I think he can get this team back on track. But he has to do it in a hurry. One thing Longhorn fans need to be very thankful about is that Heupel is a senior. He was absolutely awesome Saturday and he probably will be the best all-around quarterback the Longhorns will face this year. Here, even more briefly than usual, is how the game went: FIRST QUARTER Oklahoma won the toss and deferred. Texas took the ball and the Sooners go= t the wind. A false-start penalty on the game's second snap doomed that drive and forced a quick punt into the wind. Kris Stockton got a good roll on the low kick to the OU 43. Heupel hit four of five passes to cover the 57 yards in six plays to give OU a 7-0 lead with 11:37 left. TB Hodges Mitchell made= a great run after catching Applewhite's third-down pass to pick up a UT first down =01) but it was the only one in the first quarter. On their second tr= y, the Sooners went 77 yards in 11 plays and ran the score to 14-0 with 3:30 left. A holding penalty on the kickoff forced Texas to start frrom its 8. Another three-and-out series and punt out of the end zone gave the Sooners a short field at the UT 43. They were on the move again at the UT 29 when the period ended. SECOND QUARTER The UT defense got a great leaping interception in the end zone from CB Quentin Jammer, but it was disallowed and he was called for pass interferen= ce instead, giving OU a first down at the 2. They scored on the next play for a 21-0 lead with 14:24 left. Starting QB Major Applewhite almost connected wi= th freshman WR Roy Williams for a 45-yard completion, but the officials ruled he lost the ball on the way down and it was ruled incomplete. The Horns couldn= 't make a first down and J. T. Thatcher ran Stockton's punt back 53 yards to t= he UT 11. A personal foul on the runback set them back to the 26, but they scored in two plays for a 28-0 lead with 12:40 remaining. Chris Simms came in at quarterback and hit Williams for a first down, but a delay-of-game penal= ty negated it and Simms' next pass was intercepted by OU LB Rocky Calmus, who returned it for still another OU touchdown and a 35-0 lead with 11:30 remaining. That brought Applewhite back in and he hit WR Montrell Flowers f= or a nice gain on first down, but an illegal motion penalty forced a punt. The Sooners scored again, giving them a 42-0 lead with 4:43 left. At this point= OU's offense had been so dominant that it had faced only seven first downs all day and had converted all of them. Texas offense, meanwhile, had one first down. The UT offense finally came to life, driving 80 yards in seven plays to leave OU on top, 42-7, with 3:00 left. Mitchell got the TD from seven yards out on a pass from Applewhite. The Sooners were driving again when the half ended. It was their only drive in the first half that did not result in a TD. At the half, OU led in first downs, 18-5, in rushing yardag= e, 110-13, and in passing yardage, 182-106. THIRD QUARTER Texas finally forced OU to punt quickly to start the second half, but Applewhite, under a big rush, threw an interception that was run back to th= e UT 24. OU scored in two plays for a 49-7 lead just 1:07 deep. Simms came ba= ck in at QB and played the rest of the way. OU again drove deep into Texas territory, but freshman DE Kalen Thornton's sack of Heupel forced the Soone= rs to try a field goal and it went wide. The Sooner's next TD came after a fumble by WR Montrell Flowers at the UT 17. That made the score 56-7 with 1:26 left. Then Victor Ike, probably the swiftest of all the Longhorns, got loose on the kickoff and Sooner DB Michael Thompson caught him from behind at the OU 17. It was an 81-yard return. But the Horns lost four yards on two plays and were facing third-and-4 at the OU 21 when the quarter ended. FOURTH QUARTER A pass interference penalty against OU gave Texas a first down at the 6. Mitchell got five yards, then backup TB Kenny Hayter took an outside toss f= or the TD to make it 56-14 with 14:09 left. OU came right back for its final T= D, driving 73 yards, primarily on runs by Griffin. 900 Number Updated Daily I update my 900 number daily with football and football recruiting news. Th= e number is 1-900-288-8839. It costs $1.59 a minute. You must be 18 to call. Coach's Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday he accepts the blame for the big loss to Oklahoma, and he said the Longhorns have to bounce back because they still have a season to play and a lot of goals to accomplish if they play up to their capabilities. ""After reviewing the film, I still stand by what I said yesterday,"" Brown said. ""They outcoached us, they outhustled us, they outplayed us. They totally dominated the game, and when that happens, it comes back to me. It'= s my fault."" But he said the team still has a chance to repeat as the Big 12 South champion. ""Last year, we were 1-1 (in the Big 12) at this point. We're at t= he same spot as we were last season."" Asked if he thinks the team has a chance to rebound and win the title again= he said, ""no question about that. We're far from out of anything. We just h= ad a poor, poor performance yesterday in a game that was very important for us and our fans. For me to just throw out the season because of that would be totally asinine."" He noted that Oklahoma, after it's loss to Texas last year, beat Texas A&M, 51-6, the following week, and Stanford, after giving up 69 points to Texas last year, won the Pac 10 championship and Rose Bowl berth. ""There is a lot of anger after a loss like this by our fans,"" he said. ""Wha= t I will do this week is not look at the paper, I won't watch TV or listen to the radio. I'll be working hard all week trying to get us back on track."" He said he thought the Longhorns were ready to give a good performance against the Sooners, but he said, after three straight losses to Texas, the Oklahoma players might have just been hungrier. ""Our seniors had a chance to beat Oklahoma four straight times,"" he said. ""Some of them were crying. Most of our younger players were in shock."" He said a loss like this one forces coaches to re-evaluate everything. ""We'= ll definitely go back and look very closely at everything we're doing. We'll t= ry to simplify things."" He said some of the Longhorn players played well, but he said most of them ""played hard, but didn't play well."" ""The defense had been playing so well for us,"" he said. ""It didn't even loo= k like the same defense. Part of it was (OU QB Josh) Heupel. He played great.= ""We had a lot of mental mistakes,"" Brown said. ""We just played poorly and w= ho knows why we played that poorly? You guys will start looking at the things we should change. The fans will start looking at the things we should change. I've got to look at things that I think will work. I've got to get them bac= k on track."" Asked if he thinks there is a chance the team could fall apart because of t= he loss to the Sooners, Brown said, ""This team won't fall apart. It's a very young team with a lot of heart, a lot of class. We'll go back to work to fi= x things, simplify things."" He said the key thing is for him to be truthful with his players this week about the things they did wrong, the things they did right and the goals th= e team still can accomplish. ""This is a bad week to be going to Boulder,"" he said, noting that Colorado upset A&M in College Station last week. ""We won't ever forget this (OU) gam= e, but we still have goals to accomplish. We're still in the race for the championship in our conference."" ""The players are embarrassed and I know I'm embarrassed, but we've got to pull back together and get back to work. We've got to go back and make sure we are fundamentally sound."" 10th Anniversary This is the final issue of my 10th year of publishing True Orange. Next wee= k will be the first issue of my 11th year. While this is not a happy occasion because of the football game, my first issue was after a Texas win over OU and UT is 7-3-1 against the Sooners since True Orange began. Thanks to all of you for your continued support. True Orange Observations This was one of those games where a team has to figure out what went wrong= try to correct it, and then forget it because a game like this can be a cancer that ruins a season. Remember UCLA, 66-3, and 1997? Mack Brown won't ask for my suggestions on this, and I'm sure he can figure it out for himself, but if I were in his shoes, here is what I would do rig= ht now: 1. Give a royal chewing out to my players, my assistants and myself, becaus= e this game was an embarrassment to all Longhorns. Then I would say there are= a lot of games left to play and this game needs to be put on the shelf and th= e Colorado game should be the start of a new season for a team with a lot of goals left to accomplish. 2. Figure out the few things that have worked on offense and build future game plans around them. By the same token, I'd figure out the plays that haven't worked and quit using them. The two up-the-gut plays the Horns used on their first two plays Saturday for zero yards have been unproductive all year. Texas rarely has a running play outside the tackles, but the sweeps usually work when they are tried. I'd also ditch that sideline pass that travels 30 yards for a potential 1-yard gain =01) or an interception for a TD =01) and start throwing downfield more often. To open the game against Oklahoma State, the Longhorns had a four-yard run and two pass completions on their first three plays and didn't pick up a first down. 3. Pick a QB and go with him. Each QB has to be nervous, knowing that if he throws an interception, he'll be jerked. 4. Quit being so predictable on offense. Example: when the Horns line up in= a two-back offense and the tailback goes in motion, Texas has passed or been sacked trying to pass 100% of the time this season. There has been one run by a UT fullback all year =01) Brett Robin's touchdown in mop-up duty against OSU. That formation invites an all-out blitz. 5. If the run isn't going to be a big part of the offense, go to the shotgu= n with four wideouts as the basic formation. It gives the quarterback a bette= r chance to complete his passes, as OU QB Josh Heupel demonstrated to near perfection Saturday. Game Notes . Oklahoma QB Josh Heupel, one of the nation's top passers, had 34 net yard= s rushing Saturday, which was more than the 20 yards gained by the Longhorns' leading ground gainer, TB Hodges Mitchell. This was the second most one-sided game in the series, trailing only the 50-0 Oklahoma victory in in 1908. Texas leads the series, 55-35-5. The Sooners 534 yards and 28 first downs are both school records against the Longhorns. This was the fifth most one-sided defeat in Texas history. The bottom 10 are: 1. 1904 at Chicago 68-0 2. 1997 UCLA 66-3 3. 1988 Houston 66-15 4. 1908 at Oklahoma 50-0 5. 2000 Oklahoma 63-14 6. 1901 at Kirksville 48-0 7. 1956 at TCU 46-0 8. 1906 at Vanderbilt 45-0 9. 1956 Oklahoma 45-0 10. 1991 Miami 46-3 Baseball Team Starts Practice The Longhorn baseball begins fall practice Wednesday with 12 lettermen back from last year's team that qualified for the College World Series. The team will practice through Oct. 27, and the annual Fall World Series wi= ll be played from Oct. 25 through Oct. 27. All the practices will be open at Disch-Falk Field, and all the practices will be in the afternoon, but exact times have not been announced. Coach Augie Garrido and his assistants corraled the nation's fifth-rated recruiting class last year, and there are several pitchers in the new class who should be able to help the team this year.

lhanse@br-inc.com,"re: Lost Creek Docs. Gerald I was concerned that we didn't address what happens to the gains or losses associated with cash outs. I understand the procedures for cash out can be changed but what about the gain/loss impact to the LLC revenue stream? Original Text From: ""Gerald Nemec"" <Gerald.Nemec@enron.com>, on 7/31/00 11:06 AM: Attached is the latest set of documents which have minor revisions based on my discussions with Chris last week. These have been only redlined against the prior version, not the original versions. Let me know if you want redlines against the original docs. The LLC was not included as no changes were made from the versions already forwarded. With respect to the cash out imbalance procedures. The Administrative Services Agreement (Exhibit B) currently has a rough procedure for such cashout. It is also written such that the Members can adopt a new procedure at any time. If the current procedures are not sufficient, it probably make the most sense to have only a working draft (approved by the members) of procedures in place until we have a few month of operations under our belt to work out the bugs. Scott Sitter will be developing this draft. The development of these procedures can be done outside these current revisions. A final imbalance procedure would be adopted by written action of the members upon development of those final procedures. Let me know if you have any questions.

patrice.mims@enron.com,"Re:What's Happening? Hey girl, How's it going? Haven't had a chance to talk with you over the last two days. I went to get me hair done on Wednesday night and did not get home until 11:00 p.m. By the time I got the kids to bed, it was almost midnight and I was sick about keeping them up that late. Last night, I went to the grocery store, came home and cooked my boys a good meal of ham, macaroni and cheese and green beans. After we relaxed for a while, we started getting ready for their baths and we all went to bed around 8:30 p.m. I was exhausted from being out late Tuesday and Wednesday night. I woke up around 1:00 a.m. and watched TV for a few minutes and went back to bed. I was tired. This evening I made a nail appointment. My nails look like ""do-do"". I would like to get a new set tonight, but we'll see if we get off early enough for that. Daddy sent me a e-mail today, he had two really bad days on Wednesday and Friday, but he's scheduled to go in for more tests today. Talk with you later!",1

bruce_kohrs@keyspancanada.com,"Crestar AOS assignment to BP Dan, Grant Oh suggested I e-mail you directly to notify you of a change that BP needs included. BP states they need to have the volumes/contract number information back from Enron via e-mail by 9:45am MST in order to place nominations by 10:30am MST for the Timely Cycle. If for whatever reason Enron cannot provide the volume/contract number information by 9:45am or Enron fails to take the scheduled volume agreed to at 9:00am; and BP incurs any penalty costs including the price difference between the Enron price and the replacement price, then Enron should be liable for these costs NOT Gulf. I suggest the following options: 1) Put back in the default contract number in the Enron/Crestar agreement as we had last week, this way if Enron fails to notify by 9:45am, then Crestar/BP can nominate to the default contract number and Enron can change the contract numbers internally. 2) Add a clause to either the Enron agreement or the Gulf assignment agreement to state if Enron fails to inform and/or take, then any penalty costs/price difference incurred by Crestar/BP shall be passed onto Enron.

john.keiser@enron.com,"FW: Phase 6 Comparison: Plan vs Dave Analysis Please see the attached comparison of the Phase 6 that we have in the 2002-2006 Plan versus Dave's analysis. For the Plan, we ran it with and without Phase 6 to determine the incremental change. The worksheet attached also shows the Returns on Equity and Capitalization (with and without) based on the Plan runs. You will have a reasonable apples-to-apples if you compare the amounts at the Operating Income level because Dave did not assume how it was financed in his analysis however my depreciation is GAAP but Dave's is Tax. There are only two significant differences: 1) For conservatism, Dave used the settled rate rather than the rate refund floor rate in 2004. In Dave's calculations this made a difference of about 2.9 cents (77.60 cts vs. 74.71 cts. for the customers other than FP&L in 2004. There is no difference for FP&L because their 2004 rate cap is 74.60 cts, lower than either the settled or rate refund floor rates. (Per Dave, in the risk analyses the rate refund floor impact WAS included.) 2) We got a lower Ad Valorem tax estimate from Ted Ryan than what Dave used. ",1

aleck.dadson@enron.com,"Top 10 List for Canada Government Affairs and Recommendations for GA Group Ginger please circulate this list rather than the earlier one. TOP 10 PRIORITIES 1. Alberta Power Purchase Agreements If Enron Canada is successful in the PPA auction, Enron Canada will have a very long position in the Alberta wholesale market; continued risk mitigation efforts, advocacy of good transmission and distribution tariffs, and development of rules for Plan ""B"" for those units that received no bids) will be critical. 2. Continued support for ongoing commercial transactions other than the PPAs and help in identification of where commercial opportunities are. (An example of the latter, work with commercial people to analyze how recent initiative re transmission tariff and wholesale market design in Ontario enhance opportunities for ""Power by the Hour"" and other distributed generation projects.) 3. Ontario Electricity Market Opening work to avoid further delay in market opening and advise on the development of procedures and practices for the new market. (As an example of the latter, working with traders in Toronto and Houston to understand mechanisms for interregional trade and transmission rights, and the commercial opportunities that exist.) 4. Enhancement of wholesale market design in Alberta and Ontario. 5. Assist Enron Canada and EES Canada in better understanding rules applicable to wholesale and retail transactions in Ontario and Alberta. 6. Alberta Natrural Gas Unbundling. 7. Renewed focus on potential for restructuring of power markets in British Columbia in the event that the New Democrats (socialists) are defeated and replaced by a Liberal (pro-business) government in the province. RECOMMENDATIONS TO MAKE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MORE EFFECTIVE 1. Encourage government affairs staff based outside of Houston to make periodic visits to Houston to meet with Houston based group and to meet with commercial groups in Houston. (In our case this would include Calgary). 2. Replace or supplement the large group meetings with smaller meetings/seminars in which smaller groups can focus on issues of particular interest or enhance their understanding of a particular issue. Seminars would be more in depth than what is possible in current group meeting format. 3. Continue to enhance the information retrieval system so it is easier to locate useful material (i.e. submissions, filings, etc.). 4. Continue to emphasize to the commercial group (at all levels) the value to Enron of involving government affairs in every major transaction (value enhancing, risk mitigating) this should become the practice rather than the exception.

Given the recent issues power plant development has had in Florida (big political fights that are going the wrong way), I was wondering if it made sense to bring together a meeting of all of Public Affairs and the deal team to analyze the implications of our development plans. My primary worry is that P/L under water could have severe ecological implications that are not being internalized into the transaction. I would like to try and arrange a meeting to (1) ensure Public Affairs coordination and (2) understand the deal impacts better. Please advise if I'm worrying for no good reason. Jim",1

david.delainey@enron.com,"Re: Internal Markets Paul, I had a look at the pitch and I thought it was an intriguing idea. I think it works welll in allocating resources between competing ""going concerns"" but may be more difficult to allocate people to new businesses that may not have the income to fund the best talent. I also wonder if the cost of creating, managing and maintaining a market like this is greater than the overall benefit achieved over the existing system. In its own often clumbsy looking way Enron's culture does allocate capital and people fairly effectively. Obviously, these are very cursory remarks I have not spent a great deal of time on this.

Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees. Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out. And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year. As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt. The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it. Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings. Sincerely, Sharyn Butler",1

elizabeth.sager@enron.com,"Index Transactions EPMI is entering into more and more transactions that are settled against a floating, published index price. Our physical contract does not currently provide for what happens if the published source is not available or is otherwise materially changed. Under ISDA for financial trading, this is addressed as a Market Disruption Event (MDE). Under ENA's standard contract for financial trading, there is included as a MDE ""the imposition of trading limits on the range within which the price of the commodity may fluctuate"". What this may mean is that if a cap is imposed on power prices, then in lieu of using the capped price to determine the floating price, you would be required (under ISDA) to eventually get brokers to determine what the price would have been without the cap. I want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material changes/disappearance of the published prices that would mirror the financial trading terms and doubt whether we would want to make the imposition of a cap on power prices a MDE. If you treat the imposition of a cap (say in CA of prices to $500 or in NEPOOL to $1,000) as a MDE, then we would be required to secure quotes as to what the price would have been without the cap each time that a pricing date trades at the cap level. This only seems fraught with litigation risk to me. Alternatively, if caps are not deemed a MDE, then you would always settle against the published prices, even if they are ""artificially"" determined after the trade was entered into. While caps are not appealing, I think it would be better to not have the imposition of caps be considered a MDE. I have spoken with the financial trading group and they will follow our lead on this. So, depending upon what you both think, we will make sure that financial and physical power are treated the same on this issue. Thanks for your thoughts.",1

""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stret! ch! Trent Dilfer <<URL> QB SEA Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. Matt Hasselbeck <<URL> QB SEA Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fr! om! a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. Wayne Chrebet <<URL> WR NYJ JWillie Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams. Dedric Ward <<URL> WR MIA Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season. Lamar Smith <<URL> 1&! owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1160&>, RB MIA Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week. Marvin Minnis <<URL> WR KC Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week. Jerome Pathon <<URL> WR IND Tori U! pd! ated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week. Terrence Wilkins <<URL> WR IND Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week. Terrell Davis <<URL> RB DEN JWillie Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate h! im! He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy. Warrick Dunn <<URL> RB TB Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. Duce Staley <<URL> RB PHI Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries l! at! e in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. Joe Nedney <<URL> K TEN Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week. Erron Kinney <<URL> TE TEN Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. Kevin Dyson <<URL> WR TEN Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice. Eddie George <<URL> RB TEN Tori Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. Steve McNair <<URL> QB TEN Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. Chris Sanders <<URL> in! k?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1306&> WR TEN Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. Damon Jones <<URL> TE JAC Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. Fred Taylor <<URL> RB JAC Martin Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. Dennis Northcutt <<URL> WR CLE Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. Todd Heap <<URL> .f! antasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=235215&>, TE BAL Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. Terry Allen <<URL> RB BAL Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. Elvis Grbac <<URL> QB BAL Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. Az-Zahir Hakim <<URL> WR STL Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. Trung Canidate <<URL> =1! 87503&>, RB STL Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. J.J. Stokes <<URL> WR SF Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable. Ike Hilliard <<URL> WR NYG Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. Ron Dixon <<URL> WR NYG Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. Marshall Faulk <<URL> RB STL Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game.

larry.campbell@enron.com,"Bakersfield Environmental Action Items Louie/Ed I know you guys are busy, but because of the emphasis Enron places on ensuring that action items from consolidated audits are completed prior to the action item completion date, I really need to know how Scott and I are to proceed on the subsurface drilling activities for potential contamination at the Bakersfield Fractionator. The scheduled completion date for six of the items is 6/30. I understand the there is an issue concerning Koch's individual and shared responsibility for some of the issues identified during the audit. Rich Jolly has contacted me asking me when the drilling will begin, as he does not want to see us exceed the 6/30 date and have the items show up as deliquent in his region. Whatever you can do to assist us in either initiating the investigations or placing a hold on the drilling would be greatly appreciated. ",1

June Nasdaq prices are still within striking distance of the April high of 1995. Sideways trading the past week has negated a fledgling four-week-old uptrend on the daily bar chart. Bulls still have some heavy lifting to do and their next upside objective is resistance at the key 2,000 area. First support is seen at the 1,732 area. June S&P; 500 futures closed firmer today. Prices have leveled off the past week, after rallying solidly off the early-April low. Technically, bulls still need to push prices above the 1285 resistance area. My bias is still that any recovery in the stock market and the stock indexes won't be dramatic, but a slower grind higher, with fits and starts. First resistance is seen at 1285.00. First support is seen at 1206.00. LIVESTOCK: June live cattle closed 2 cents higher at 71.12. Prices closed at the session low and managed to fill an upside gap on the daily bar chart that was created in early trading. The market saw another upside corrective bounce earlier today, after punching to a fresh 6.5-month low last Friday. The bears are in control of the market. Prices are still trading below an accelerating two-month-old downtrend line on the daily bar chart. The market is still a bit short-term oversold, and I would not be surprised to see more of an upside correction this week. Next support, basis June, is seen at $71.00. First resistance now comes in at the $72.00 level. August feeder cattle closed up 3 cents today at $88.25. Prices closed at the session low today. Range-bound trade continues. As this market neared the bottom end of the recent trading range, which is around $87.50, the market again took an upside bias. Look for more choppy trading between $89 and $87.50. If prices can break out of that aforementioned range, the direction of the breakout will likely be the direction of the next significant trend. Next resistance is seen at $88.70-- today's high. First support is seen at $88.00. June lean hogs closed $0.15 higher today, at $67.50. Prices are still showing consolidation at lower levels, after the sell off last week. Hogs are still a bit overdone on the downside, on a short-term basis, so some more corrective upside consolidation would not surprise me. Still, the bears have the strong momentum on their side at present. Next support lies at $66.25. First resistance is located at the 68.15 level--today's high. GRAINS: July corn futures closed off 3 cents at $2.05 today. Crop progress reports out Monday evening showing very good planting progress in the U.S. weighed on the corn market today. There is just not much bullish fundamental news in the corn market right now. The weak wheat market is also weighing on corn. On Monday, respected Iowa State University Climatologist Elwynn Taylor predicted record yields for the Corn Belt this year. It would not surprise me to see the commodity funds make another significant downside assault on the corn and bean markets in the near term. Next support is now seen at $2.00. Next resistance is seen at the $2.07 1/2 level--today's high. July soybeans closed 2 3/4 cents higher at $4.40 1/2 today. Prices are consolidating the recent gains, but bulls still by no means have any significant momentum. Fundamentally, there is not much in the way of good news for bulls right now. I would not be surprised to see the commodity funds make another downside push in beans in the near term. This market is still in technical trouble and it's going to take a significant weather scare this spring or summer to force prices solidly higher. First resistance is seen at the $4.45 area and then $4.50. First support is seen at $4.35 and then at $4.30. July soybean meal closed off $1.10 at $155.70 today. Prices this week are showing a corrective pullback after they pushed to a fresh eight-week high last Friday. Recent price action is still encouraging to the bulls and is a sign the lows are in place in the meal market. Next resistance comes in at the $158.50 area. First support is seen at $154.00. July bean oil closed 22 points higher at 15.09 cents today. Prices saw a corrective bounce today after dropping to a new contract low of 14.76 cents on Monday. This market is technically much weaker than beans or meal, and is still a bit overdone on the downside, on a short-term basis. I would be surprised if there is much downside left in oil. Next resistance comes in at 15.25 cents. Next support is seen at the contract low of 14.76 cents. July Chicago wheat closed 2 1/2 cents lower at $2.66 3/4 today. Prices poked to a new contract low of $2.65. More rain in the Plains has cast a bearish pall over the market. With the wheat crop behind schedule anyway, the recent rains could allow the crop to make some good improvement. Bears are in full command. Just last week, prices pushed to a fresh six-week high. Serious technical damage has occurred the past few sessions. First support lies at the contract low of $2.65. Next resistance is seen at $2.70. This market is short-term oversold and I suspect we'll see a corrective bounce soon. SOFTS: July N.Y. sugar closed 18 points higher at 9.10 cents today. We could see a bull flag starting to form in sugar, on the daily bar chart. This many times occurs as prices consolidate steep gains. A three-month high was scored in July sugar late last week. The bulls have good momentum and a steep and accelerating five-week-old uptrend line is still in place on the daily bar chart. Next resistance now comes in at 9.25 cents. First support is now seen at 8.80 cents. July N.Y. coffee closed 15 points higher at 68.90 cents today. Prices pushed to another fresh two-month high today as the bulls continue to gain momentum. This recent move is the most significant showing by the bulls since mid-January. The fact that prices have not sold off sharply the past three sessions is encouraging for the bulls, too--given recent price history. Still, the bears could be setting a trap, like they did in early January. If bulls can push prices above 70 cents and then see follow-through strength, bears will begin to think this uptrend is sustainable. First resistance comes in at 70 cents. First support is seen 65.00 cents. July N.Y. cocoa closed $55 higher today, at $1,044. Today's strong gap-higher trade on the daily bar chart put the bulls back on a level playing field with the bears in a hurry. Prices pushed above and negated a 2.5-month-old downtrend line on the daily bar chart. Next resistance comes in at $1,050 and then $1,060. First support is now seen at today's low of $1,001. July cotton closed 99 points lower at 45.44 cents today. Cotton is in a strong bear market, and a new contract low was scored just today, at 45.40 cents. Right now, any rebounds are likely to be just selling opportunities for the bears. But, my bias is still that we are not that far from a bottoming process. Next support lies at 45.00 cents. First resistance is seen around 48.00 cents. Would-be bottom-pickers should beware. Bulls need to watch for some ""basing"" action, which may be beginning. July orange juice futures closed 45 points lower today, at 76.95 cents. Prices late last week probed into an important gap area on the daily bar chart, which begins at 77.85 cents, but did not fill that gap on the upside. Bears rule and the market is still technically weak. However, if the aforementioned gap can be filled on the upside, that's an important first step for the bulls in turning the market around. That gap will be filled if prices move above 78.55 cents, which is first resistance. Next support comes in at 76.00 cents. July lumber futures closed $2.60 lower at $308.40 today. Prices just Monday hit yet a new for-the-move high, at $313.20, as the bull market roars on. Today's price action is just some healthy consolidation in a bull market. Expect more volatility, however, as is typical for this market. The next upside objective for the bulls is the $315.00 area. First support is seen at the $300.00 area. This market is still short-term overbought, technically, and I would not be surprised to see a decent downside correction soon. METALS: June COMEX gold closed down $1.00 today, at $265.50. Prices late last week pushed to a new seven-week high. Despite recent choppy trading, this market is still trending up from its early-April low. But bulls need to see some solid upside movement soon to keep what momentum they have recently gained. But the fact that prices have not sold way off after the rally is encouraging to the bulls. Next resistance is located at $268. First support is seen at $264.00. July silver closed up $0.008 today, at $4.335 an ounce. Prices are not that far above the contract low. Still, prices are chopping at lower levels. This suggests a ""basing"" action that many markets need to change the trend from down, to sideways, to eventually up. Next support is seen at $4.30. First resistance is seen at $4.41. Bears still have the advantage. July N.Y. copper closed 1.80 cents lower today, at 76.85 cents. Stock market weakness helped drive this market lower today. Prices are still attempting to build a base and recover from the early-April low. My bias is still that the downside is limited for copper. The stock market and the U.S. economy will have to be healthy before the bulls can really get something going in copper, however. Next resistance is seen at 78.00 cents. Next support is seen at 76.00 cents. ENERGIES: July crude closed $0.19 lower at $28.35 today. Bulls and bears are at a stand-off and will duke it out over the near term. Expect more choppy trading. Next support is seen at 28.00. Next resistance lies at $29.50. July heating oil closed 30 points higher today, at .7551. Bulls still have the slight edge, but look for more choppy trading in the near future. Next support is seen at 73.00 cents. Next resistance is seen at 77.50 cents. July unleaded gasoline closed 128 points lower at .9898 today. Prices scored a new contract high just Monday, and saw follow-through selling today. That confirms a key reversal in this market. But given the recent volatility in unleaded, I am not placing a lot of emphasis on this key reversal. Bulls are still in command as peak driving season nears. Top-pickers beware! Next resistance is seen at $1.03. First support is seen at $.9600. July natural gas closed 3.6 cents higher at $4.35 today. Today was just an upside correction in a steep downtrend. Prices hit a fresh five-and-one-half-month low Monday. Next support is seen at $4.25 and first resistance is now at $4.50. This market is still short-term oversold, technically. FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The June Euro currency closed 62 points lower at .8828 today. Bears have the decided edge again as bulls have lost all the momentum they had gained in mid-April. My bias is still that there is not much downside left in the Euro. Look for more choppy action in the near term. Bulls will again gain good momentum if they can push prices above the .9075 area. Next support is now seen at .8800. Next resistance is seen at .9000. The June Japanese yen closed 5 points lower at .8279 today. Prices pushed to a fresh six-week high last Friday, but bears are still in control. Bulls are hoping for some ""basing"" activity at lower levels, and that may be occurring, although it's too early to tell. Next support now lies at the .8100 level. First resistance is seen at the .8326 level. The June Swiss franc closed 36 points lower today, at .5739. Bears are in command. Still, my bias is that prices won't deteriorate much more. Next support is seen at the .5700 level. First resistance comes in at the .5830 level. The June Australian dollar futures closed 37 points lower at .5150 today. Prices pushed to a fresh two-month high late last week and are consolidating a bit this week. The bulls still have the advantage as a five-week-old uptrend line is in place on the daily bar chart. My bias is that the lows are in place. First resistance is now seen at .5250. First support is now seen at .5100. The June Canadian dollar closed 14 points lower today, at .6464. Prices sold off some more today after the key reversal down on the daily bar chart that was scored Monday. Bulls had good momentum, but have lost some the past two sessions. The key reversal does not indicate prices are headed back toward the lows seen a few weeks ago. What it does suggest is a decent downside correction to the recent gains will occur over the near term. This currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside. Next resistance is seen at the .6548 level. First support is seen at the .6450 level. The June British pound closed 126 points lower at 1.4244. Trading continues choppy at lower levels. This currency was not that far above recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside in the sterling. One could argue that price action the past few weeks has been a ""basing"" before prices eventually turn north. A move above the 1.4500 level would be considered a bullish ""upside breakout"" from the recent congestion area. Next support is now seen at the 1.4200 level. Next resistance comes in at the 1.4400 level. The June U.S. dollar index closed 75 points higher at 116.24 today. Bulls are regaining momentum. The recent double-top reversal on the daily bar chart still favors the bears longer-term. Next resistance lies at the 116.50 level. First support is seen at the 114.50 area. My bias is still that a near-term top is in place in the dollar index. June U.S. T-bonds closed 17/32 lower today at 101 21/32. Prices scored a bearish ""outside day"" down on the daily bar chart today, whereby the high was higher and the low was lower than the previous session's trading range, with a lower close. Bulls need to show some resolve soon, after pushing prices well off the lows scored in late April. A steep six-week-old downtrend line was penetrated on the upside last week and negated. Also, a minor double-bottom reversal has occurred on the daily bar chart. Next resistance is seen at 103 9/32. First support is seen at 101 even.

Despite a somewhat depressed secondary aluminum market, Hydro Aluminum Metal Products North America (Louisville, Ky.) a subsidiary of Norsk Hydro ASA (NYSE:NHY) (Oslo, Norway) will spend over $100 million on new facilities over a five year period. As part of a continuing strategy to expand its international network of secondary aluminum smelters, which includes five in Europe, Hydro Aluminum has started construction of its second grassroot North American secondary aluminum smelter to be located in Commerce, Texas. The $37 million plant is scheduled to start operations late this year. The plant will produce 90,000 metric tons a year of aluminum billet from recycled scrap for sale to extruders and other aluminum end users. 2001 was an active year for Hydro, not only did they open their first grassroot secondary aluminum smelter in Henderson, Ky., they also acquired Wells Aluminum and its associated secondary smelter in Monett, Mo. This will give the company three secondary aluminum smelters with a total capacity of 260,000 metric tons starting in 2003 when the Commerce plant will be in full operation. The company has plans on the drawing board for a fourth smelter to supply the northeastern U.S., once market conditions necessitate the demand. As competitors have downsized recently, Hydro Aluminum has gone against the grain utilizing its industry experience and energy efficient technology to become a world leader in the aluminum billet market. Norsk Hydro is an industrial leader-based in Norway and focused on world growth of oil and gas resources, light metals and agricultural.

adrian.montague@socgen.co.uk," Jim, I promised you some contact details. Although I'm a little late with formal notification, as from the beginning of the year I joined Societe Generale on a part-time basis. I'm a Senior International Adviser which means I do pretty much anything I want to turn my hand to. Jay Worenklein, who's the Global Head of Project Finance in New York, is an old friend and we have always said that it would be fun to work together if the opportunity ever arose. In parallel with the SG role, I am continuing with the two roles for the British Government I had previously mentioned to you: as adviser to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Transport on the use of private finance in the transport sector, and as non-executive Deputy Chairman of Partnerships UK, the new merchant bank cum project developer the Government has formed to take forward its well-known private finance programme. So you can see that I've finally ended up with the sort of portfolio we were discussing last fall. Contact details are as follows: Mobile 44 7802 655 605 At Partnerships UK 44 20 7273 8341 (direct) 44 20 7273 8357 (my personal secretary Carole James- who can usually be relied upon to know where I am) 44 20 7273 8383 (switch) 44 20 7273 8367 (fax) e-mail: adrian.montague@partnershipsuk.org.uk At Societe Generale 44 20 7676 6821 (direct) 44 20 7676 6881 (Nicola White who tends to now where I am when I'm at SG, or is a good point of call if Carole is not there) 44 30 7676 6000 (switch) 44 20 7667 2487 (fax) e-mail: as above Since I move between offices a fair amount, if you send an e-mail, it's best to send to both addressed at once.

david.forster@enron.com,"Charges Andy, When you have some time, can we get together on the circumstances under which we should charge a business unit for the addition of a new Product Type? I'm thinking specifically of the units which do receive a cost allocation, but are adding products which in our opinion are of questionable economic benefit. These could be charged in accordance with our current price schedule. i.e. new Product Types added to existing businesses could be charged the incremental setup fees. New Businesses would be the 250K. If the Product Type is of clear benefit (e.g. Options for US Gas and for the guys we are training this week), then the costs would be part of next year's allocation.

Morgan. Trading volume was thin, which may have exaggerated some of today's losses. Nevertheless, both indexes posted new lows for the month thereby leaving the doors open for additional weakness into mid-February. The NASDAQ closed down 25.80 points at 1812.72 and below the 38% retracement level of the September/January rally. If the decline continues, November's reaction low crossing at 1782.48 marks the next level of support. The March S&P 500 index also closed lower on Tuesday and below the 38% retracement level of the September/January rally crossing at 1087.97. The door is open for a possible test of the late-October low crossing at 1060.60 later this month. March closed down 5.70 points at 1083.30. The Dow posted a quiet inside day with a lower close on Wednesday. Losses were limited as Cisco Systems rekindled investor confidence in U.S. companies with word that second- quarter results will exceed current estimates. However, investors remain very nervous about current stock valuations amidst suspicions over corporate accounting irregularities. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that additional weakness is likely on Thursday that could lead to a test of last week's low crossing at 9529.40. If this support level is broken, it would open the door for a possible test of long-term fib support crossing at 9318.20 later this month. INTEREST RATES <URL> March T-bonds posted an inside day with a lower close on Wednesday amidst a relatively quiet session on Wall Street. Additional pressure came from lower than expected participation of an auction of 10-year notes. March continues to consolidate below January's high crossing at 104-11. If this resistance level is cleared, January's high crossing at 105-06 is a potential target later this month. Stochastics and a number of other short-term momentum indicators are bullish but diverging, which is often a precursor to a top and trend change. The CRB INDEX <URL> The CRB index posted a key reversal down on Wednesday as it was pressured by weakness in energies, grains, hogs, bellies and some precious metals. Wednesday's rally was halted dead in its tracks following a spike of January's downtrend line crossing near 190.50. The CRB's failure to close above this resistance level and the previous reaction high crossing at 190.29 is short-term bearish and leaves the door open for additional weakness for the balance of the week. At the same time, stochastics and the RSI have turned bullish hinting that last week's low might have marked a mid-winter low. ENERGY MARKETS <URL> The energy markets closed lower on Tuesday following this week's bearish inventory reports and sluggish demand. Additional pressure came from a report out of Kuwait that it will resume oil exports from its northern fields just one week after an explosion shut down one third if its output. March crude oil closed lower for the third day in a row thereby increasing the odds that last Friday's high marked the upper boundary of a late-winter trading range. Additional weakness later this week would turn a number of short-term momentum indicators neutral to bearish thereby signaling that sideways to lower prices might be possible into mid-February. It remains unlikely that March will breakout above the upper boundary of this winter's trading range crossing at 22.50 in the near future. March heating oil closed lower on Wednesday as it extended this week's sell off from last Friday's high. This week's bearish inventory report along with bearish extended weather forecast for the high-demand regions of the U.S. continues to weigh on prices. March heating oil has fallen back into January's trading range and in doing so has turned a number of short-term momentum indicators neutral to bearish. I would not be surprised to see March heating oil breakout below this winter's trading range as it posts a new contract low later this month. March unleaded gas closed sharply lower on Wednesday retracing just over 50% of last week's rebound since Monday. Rising inventories and weak demand continue to offset the approach of seasonal trend changes in the market. Stochastics and the RSI turned bearish with today's weakness signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible during the first half of February. March Henry Hub natural gas closed slightly higher due to short covering ahead of this afternoon's AGA inventory report on Wednesday. This afternoon's report showed a draw of 82 billion cubic feet of natural gas taken from storage, the low end of expectations. This could limit if not pressure prices on Thursday as the market still has over 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas hanging over the market. CURRENCIES <URL> The March Dollar posted a potential downside reversal on Wednesday after early strength tied to short covering faded into the close. However, the near mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Thursday. March needs to close below Monday's low crossing at 118.96 to confirm a breakout below January's uptrend line. Until then, I caution anyone against becoming too bearish despite the overbought condition of the market. The March Swiss Franc remained within Tuesday's trading range but closed higher on Wednesday due to short covering. Today's close above last week's high crossing at .5898 increases the odds that a double bottom with December's low was posted last week. However, closes above this winter's downtrend line crossing near .6010 are needed before this can be confirmed. This week's rebound has turned the daily ADX bullish signaling that additional short covering is possible. Today's mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Thursday. I would caution anyone from becoming too bullish this market until this winter's downtrend line has been broken. The March Canadian Dollar closed sharply lower on Wednesday, which led to a test of January's uptrend line crossing near .6230 and coincides with previous support. Closes below .6230 would signal an end to this winter's short covering bounce while opening the door for sideways to lower prices into mid-February. This week's setback has turned stochastics and the RSI bearish thereby increasing the odds for sideways to lower prices near-term. The March Japanese Yen closed slightly higher on Wednesday as it consolidated some of Tuesday's loss. The March yen is at a crossroads and will need to close above last fall's downtrend line crossing near .7600 or below last week's low crossing at .7416 to clear up near-term direction in the market. If this winter's decline resumes, weekly support crossing at .7371 is March's next target. PRECIOUS METALS <URL> April gold closed slightly lower on Wednesday amidst profit taking. Early strength was due to spillover buying interest due to a breakdown in investor confidence over the valuation of equity prices. However, a relatively quiet trading day on Wall Street triggered a round profit taking following April's break out into new contract highs on Tuesday. Aprils could spend the balance of this week consolidating above broken resistance crossing at 297.50. If the rally resumes later this month, weekly resistance crossing at 322 is April's next target. Momentum indicators are bullish but becoming overbought warning bulls that a rebound in the equity markets could trigger a round of long-liquidation as skittish investors rotate capital out of gold and back into stocks. March silver posted a downside reversal on Wednesday. Overnight strength fell just short of testing the 50% retracement level of January's decline crossing at 4.492. However, a lack of panic selling in the equity markets early in the day session triggered a round of profit taking that extended into the close. Wednesday's low-range close leaves the door open for a steady to weaker opening for Thursday. A lower close on Thursday would signal that the initial rebound off last week's low has likely come to an end. March copper closed lower on Wednesday as profit taking continues following last week's dramatic run up. March's inability to sustain a breakout above November's high crossing at 73.70 along with a number of short-term momentum indicators turning neutral to bearish from overbought levels hints that a broad double top might be in place. Wednesday's mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Thursday as March might try to consolidate some of this week's losses. GRAINS <URL> March corn posted a new contract low on Wednesday following reports that Malaysia bought at least one cargo of Chinese corn for April shipment. The renewed Chinese exports combined with sluggish U.S. exports triggered another round of fund selling amidst a lack of buying interest. A short covering bounce ahead of the close allowed March corn to close at long-term support crossing at 2.04 1/4. If the decline continues, psychological support crossing at 2.00 is March's next target later this month. Pre-report sales exports for Thursday range from 750K to 950K metric tons, which is still well below the pace needed to reach this year's export projection. Fears that the USDA will be forced to lower its export projection possibly on Friday also weighted on prices today. Unless the U.S. Dollar falls making U.S. corn more competitive with other feed grains on the world market and or export demand sees a significant increase in the near future, corn prices will continue to decline until increased demand surfaces. March wheat posted an inside day with a lower close on Wednesday due to spill over weakness from corn and soybeans. It's the same old story the bears continues to beat the strong U.S. Dollar has made U.S. wheat less competitive on the world market resulting in sluggish export demand. Today's low-range close leaves the door open for additional weakness on Thursday if export sales prove disappointing. December's low crossing at 2.77 marks the next level of support. Closes below this low could lead to an eventual test of the contract low crossing at 2.73 later this winter. Pre-report sales estimates range from 450K to 600K metric tons. March wheat will need to close above January's downtrend line crossing near 2.86 to temper the near-term bearish outlook in the market. SOYBEAN COMPLEX <URL> March soybeans closed sharply lower on Wednesday erasing most of this week's short covering gains. Today's sell off was triggered by a lack of fresh market friendly news, the start of harvest in Brazil and China's unwillingness to postpone its March 20th deadline for implementation of GMO policies regarding soybean imports. While a short covering bounce late in the day tempered some of today's losses, the door remains open for a likely test of last week's low in the near future. Traders are looking for tomorrow's export sales report to come in between 600K to 800K metric tons. While there is some talk that the USDA might raise its export projection for this year in Friday's report, bearish traders are quick to say that any increase has already been factored into prices. Until March soybeans can close above the reaction high crossing at 4.39 1/2, the February low has not been confirmed. March soybean meal posted a key reversal down on Wednesday as it filled the gap crossing at 147.90 in early trading. A short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today's gains leaving the door open for sideways trading on Thursday. Pre-report export sales estimates range from 75K to 140K metric tons. Today's near mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Thursday however; trading is likely to be subdued ahead of Friday's supply/demand report. Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible during the first half of February. LIVESTOCK <URL> April hogs closed lower on Wednesday pressured by steady to lower cash bids and soft packer demand. Light markets tempered today's sell off as April consolidated above broken resistance crossing at 61.90. Nearby cash fundamentals continue to look sloppy with a weak tone in pork cutout values and shrinking packer margins. Favorable weather conditions are also a potential bearish factor. If the rally continues, weekly resistance, crossing at 63.60 is a potential target later this week. At the same time, both daily and weekly stochastics are overbought hinting that a major top appears to be near. However, closes below initial trendline support crossing near $61 are needed before this is confirmed. April cattle closed higher on Wednesday and above the 75% retracement level of last year's decline crossing at 76.00. If the rally continues, the bottom of last summer's trading range crossing at 77.10 is a target later this month. Today's rally was triggered by higher boxed beef values. Cash bids have not be established however, bullish traders are hoping to see $72 bids later this week. Wednesday's high-range close leaves the door open for additional gains on Thursday. FOOD FIBER <URL> March coffee closed slightly higher on Wednesday due to light short covering following a gap lower opening, which was triggered by origin and fund selling. However, light trade buying after the opened triggered a short covering bounce that lasted into the close. March is at a crossroad and needs to close above 46.20 or below 44.00 to clear up near-term direction in the market. Momentum indicators are very oversold hinting that a short covering bounce might be needed soon. March cocoa posted an inside day with a higher close due to short covering that left Tuesday's downside reversal unconfirmed. Closes above January's high at 1422 would negate the possibility that a double top is forming while opening the door for a possible test of weekly resistance crossing at 1508 later this winter. Stochastics are still bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible near-term. March will need to close below last week's low crossing at 1327 to temper the bullish outlook in the market. May sugar closed higher on Wednesday but below mid-range. Early strength fell short of testing broken support marked by last October's low crossing at 601. Until May can post multiple closes above this broken support level thereby tempering the bearish outlook in the market, the door remains open for additional weakness later this month and a possible test of weekly support crossing at 5.48. Momentum indicators are oversold but remain bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible near-term. March cotton posted a quiet inside day with a slightly higher close on Wednesday as the market waits for near-term direction following the release of Thursday's export sales report. A friendly report on Thursday could renew March's rally off last week's low that could lead to a test of January's high crossing at 38.50 later this month. Barring a major surprised in tomorrow's report, upside potential appears limited ahead of Friday's supply/demand report. Cotton will likely remain range bound until the market gets a better handle on this year's planted acreage.

solutions@zepower.com,"FORWARD PRICE VIEWS FOR COMPETITIVE ENERGY MARKETS Link to <URL> [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] Forward Price Views for Competitive Energy Markets [IMAGE] =09 [IMAGE] Dear Jubran, Recognizing the pronounced volatility and uncert= ainty in the energy industry, ZE PowerGroup has developed processes and t= ools to facilitate dynamic trading and risk management. One of the foremos= t tools required for competitive operation is the availability of represen= tative forward natural gas and power views for the various market hubs. Given that generation resource development, price behavior and industry re= sponsiveness has been significantly outside of historic norms established during the extended period of regulation, and given recent world events ha= ve resulted in greater uncertainty in the economy it is critical that an o= rganization be able to probabilistically predict future prices, with some degree of accuracy. The market is always asking itself questions like: S= hould I commit to a deal now or wait? For how much and for how long should= I commit? What is the impact of this transaction on my portfolio? How do m= arket events impact near, mid and long term pricing? How long will the pric= e remain at the current level? A forward view is a prerequisite to manage and optimize on an energy portfolio in competitive markets. ZE PowerGroup provides short, mid and long-term Forward Price Views. The Forward Price V= iews are developed using sophisticated, top-down market simulation models that are readily customizable and adaptable in size and scope to any regi= on in North America. The Forward Price Models have been designed using the= key drivers and fundamental parameters of the natural gas and electrical power industries in combination with econometric techniques and expert jud= gment. The value of the model is in its ability to extract and quantify th= e expert judgment. The difference between the ZE PowerGroup Forward Price Model and other models is that of a top-down market simulation versus bott= om-up generation modeling. The bottom-up generation model does not always account for market behavior and assumes that generation is predominantly economically. These modes make little or no allowance for market power, in= efficiencies, gaming or other operational or unique market factors. ZE Po= werGroup developed their first price views in 1996. The Forward Price Mode= l has performed well as a guiding tool; the views created from the models have consistently predicted the direction of price movement in the markets= It was one of the few models that predicted rapid and consistent price i= ncreases after deregulation when the industry consensus was that prices wo= uld retreat. Clients who have incorporated the price views into their stra= tegic planning have reaped significant benefits and mitigated price risks;= fairing better than their counterparts. The Forward Price Model can be c= oupled with the Market Monitoring subscription, which adds value through t= argeted intelligence required to optimize positioning in uncertain and vol= atile markets. ZE PowerGroup strives to provide timely and required intell= igence at reasonable cost. For more information on ZE PowerGroup's Forwar= d Price Views or on subscribing to a monthly market monitoring service, pl= ease visit our web page at <URL> contact us by email at paul@ze.co= m or by phone at 604-244-1469.

moneyadm2@timeinc.net,"Sivy on Stocks: Aluminum shines Please respond to Sivy on Stocks SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com May 9, 2001 Aluminum shines The economy should come back later this year, and classic cyclical stocks, such as Alcoa, have already begun major upswings. By Michael Sivy Amid all the concern about technology stocks, many investors seem to have forgotten that the traditional business cycle still exists. But while the drop and the more recent recovery in tech has been the most dramatic event in the stock market, companies in other sectors have felt the results of the economic slowdown, too. In fact, many traditional cyclical companies experienced a classic bear market that ended a few months ago and they now appear to be in the first phase of a recovery that could last as long as five years. The biggest gains figure to be in industries that benefit both from improving economic activity and from moderate increases in inflation. Chief among these stocks are the producers of raw materials. Since the supply of commodities can't change very quickly, prices are set largely by the level of demand. As a result, an economic upturn can make commodities prices firm up quite suddenly. Moreover, initial inflation pressures such as those that have been reported in the past couple of months typically show up in the prices of metals before they show up in manufactured goods and services. Alcoa [AA] is a prime example of such a stock. The world's largest aluminum producer, Alcoa's earnings hardly fell during the slowdown of the past nine months. Growth is expected to revive and accelerate over the rest of 2001. And next year, the company is projected to increase earnings more than 30 percent. Alcoa's resilience has several sources. One has been aggressive cost reduction. Alcoa has already trimmed annual costs by $1 billion and plans to cut $1 billion more. In addition, the aluminum giant has been shedding non-core assets, such as an alumina refinery in Australia and the Thiokol propulsion business that it acquired through an acquisition. Over the next couple of years, Alcoa should become a more focused and more profitable company. Despite all this good news, Alcoa's results have been held back by three factors the general economic slowdown, the somewhat depressed aerospace market and the West Coast electricity shortage, which has idled some production capacity. All three, however, are about to improve. The economy should be in a solid recovery by next year. The construction of commercial aircraft should reach a peak in the next few years, thanks to new models from both Airbus and Boeing. And power availability in the Pacific Northwest will eventually recover as well. The result will be an extraordinarily strong upswing in earnings that will rival those of some tech stocks. Over the next five years, Alcoa's earnings should increase faster than 15 percent annually. At $41.50, Alcoa is trading at just about 20 times estimated earnings for the current year and less than 16 times next year's projected results. That compares with an average P/E of 18 over the past six years. For anyone looking to balance a tech portfolio without sacrificing above-average growth, Alcoa is a perfect choice.

news@darwinawards.com,"Darwin Awards Newsletter 09 January 2001 DARWIN AWARDS NEWSLETTER 09 January 2001 IN THIS ISSUE: Darwin Award: COP CAP Darwin Award: SLOW LEARNER Darwin Award: THIRST FOR DEATH Honorable Mention: SHELL NECKLACE Personal Account: THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE Darwin Award: COP CAP August 2001, Missouri When the Pierce City Chief of Police reached into his trunk and pulled out his shotgun, he should have remembered to point the gun aside. But even the best-trained men make mistakes. His ""quick draw"" precipitated a fatal self-shooting when the trigger caught on a loop of fabric, and he accidentally peppered himself with bullets. Darwin Award: SLOW LEARNER Two reminders to fasten your seatbelt before risking your life. March 2001, Virginia Brandon, 21, was driving to the courthouse to face charges of reckless driving, speeding, driving without a license, and failure to wear seat belts, when he lost control of his speeding vehicle. The Hyundai crossed the median of Interstate 64 and collided with a truck pulling a flatbed trailer carrying three cars. As luck would have it, Brandon had again chosen not to wear his seatbelt. He was ejected from the car, and died at the scene. March 2001, North Carolina Justin's tale is more complicated, but his fate is equally apt. A failure to wear his seatbelt led him to 18 days in a coma, after he crashed his car at 90 miles per hour and was ejected from a window. But that was only the first of his mistakes. One year later, Justin was riding with a friend, again sans seatbelt, when the speeding vehicle careened off the pavement. Once again he was involuntarily ejected from the window, only this time he was killed on impact.

A Christchurch driver with little patience for those dangerous curves was preparing a hot cup of tea in her car when she learned one last lesson about respect for the road. Nothing, but nothing, could keep her from her afternoon tea that day. Well all right, one thing could keep her from her tea. Karma. While she was trying to brew a cuppa, her car plunged over a precipice and into a creek. The woman was found dead three days later, still holding a box of teabags, with a mug wedged against the steering wheel and a thermos of hot water beneath her feet. There were no brake marks on the road. Read our new book! 119 astounding Darwin Awards tales and more... <URL> Send me a SASE and I'll send you an autographed bookplate. Darwin Awards Bookplate, 375 Hudson St., New York NY 10014 Honorable Mention: SHELL NECKLACE March 2001, Washington A 19-year-old Spokane man damaged his hand while attempting to string a necklace of live ammunition. He was punching holes in the shell casings using an awl and hammer, when one of the projectiles exploded in his hands. Perhaps he should have collected the shells from the beach, instead of the artillery range. Personal Account: THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE (Thanks Alex!) April 1998, Canada Some people talk smart but act like future Darwin Award winners. I had just emerged from my high school chemistry class, not my best subject. On my way to the cafeteria, I was joined by Mr. Junior Einstein, who was happily spouting chemical gibberish. He began pontificating on the reactions caused by adding heat to certain elements such as neon and aluminum. Once we reached the cafeteria, he nonchalantly placed his food in the microwave oven. As it cooked, Einstein explained that aluminum can explode when heated sufficiently. As he talked, I began to detect the faint scent of smoke in the air, which I mentioned to my guest lecturer. As we turned towards the microwave, his jaw dropped low enough to accommodate a rack of test tubes. His dish of food was blazing. One second later the oven was rocked by a loud Kablaam! This candidate for an Honorable Mention suddenly discovered that theoretical knowledge does not equal practical wisdom. The chemistry lesson he learned in the cafeteria was far more valuable: ""Don't mix aluminum foil with heat!""

bmiimarket@eudoramail.com,"BMII- A Marketing Giant in the Making USIQKFHAK =20 Emerging Growth Stock Alert Blagman Media International: A Marketing Giant= in the Making=09 Key Points about BMII: BMII projects a total run rate of between $8= 0-100 million in 2002. BMII currently manages an advertising and promotion= al campaign for MET-Rx, the nation's leader in sports supplements. Centur= y Media, BMII's pending acquisition target, is one of the nation's largest direct marketing firms, with a dozen Fortune 1000 companies as clients. BMII has the exclusive rights to market and advertise the national video re= lease of a four video collector's set of the best of ""The Red Skelton Show.= Company Name Blagman Media International (OTCBB: BMII) Current Price $0.0012 (12 hundredths of one cent) 52-Week High $0.56 52-Week Low $0.0011 Company Background Today we have a look at a classic merge and conquer s= cenario in the $200 billion dollar Direct Response sector. The conqueror-t= o-be is called BMII (Blagman Media International, Inc.) The new company wil= l combine the talents and clients of some of the biggest names in the infom= ercial world under the Blagman name. With its announced plans to acquire m= ajor companies such as Century Media Inc. and Wellworld Group Ltd., BMII ha= s quickly established a gateway for major immediate revenue stream coupled with rapid internal growth. A-List clients have included the likes of Proc= tor Gamble, Kodak, Dainler-Chrysler, Black and Decker, Home Shopping Netw= ork, and TriStar. Total combined billings for BMII upon the completion of its acquisitions are expected to run from $80 to $100 million dollars in 20= 02. This will give BMII the financial leverage and the know-how to change the face of the Direct Response industry. Industry Stats According to the= Direct Marketing Association (DMA), U.S. direct marketing expenditures c= urrently at $191.6 billion, are expected to continue to grow annually at 7.= 1% from 2002 until 2005. Moreover, U.S. sales revenue due to direct market= ing is estimated to reach more than $1.8 trillion for 2001. Through 2005, s= uch sales are estimated to grow by 9.6% annually to reach $2.7 trillion. Again- Direct Response will cause $2.7 trillion (estimated) in sales by 200= 5. This figure goes to show the effectiveness of direct marketing as well as the likelihood that demand for Direct Response will continue to grow ove= r the years. BMII's Growth Strategy Recognizing the opportunity for str= ategic consolidation in the Direct Response industry, the management of Cen= tury Media and Blagman decided to utilize BMII to facilitate the acquisitio= n strategy. Through its public position, BMII assumed the lead role in the= financing and negotiated the acquisition for a combination of stock and ca= sh. The company's senior management and board will consist of a combinatio= n of senior managers from both companies. Currently, no other direct indep= endent competitor to BMII is in the field of Direct Response having the bre= adth and depth of its combined enterprises. At present, 99% of the pure pl= ay infomercial business is privately held. And for good reason. The margi= ns offered by Direct Response sales are three and four times greater than t= raditional bricks-and-mortar retail. Profit potential that makes BMII a sto= ck with tremendous upside. BMII CEO Robert Blagman understands the Infom= ercial sector. Says Blagman, ""The primary purpose of these reverse merger= s was to make BMII public and create a new BMII, a vehicle with which to bu= ild a media-buying infrastructure. BMII will streamline operations, combin= e miscellaneous expenses, and create synergies within this larger structure= to increase economies of scale and lower costs-per-eyeball for their clien= ts."" In Conclusion Given its accomplishments and current plans, BMII appe= ars to have great upside potential in the exciting infomercial market. Bla= gman Media International has demonstrated is ability to capture substantial= clients, as evidenced by its impressive client base. The acquisitions of Century Media and Wellworld will provide BMII with an even larger client ba= se with plenty of experience under its wing. With an expected $80-100 m= illion in billings for 2002 and the prospect of additional mergers, acquisi= tions, and new ventures, BMII gives investors plenty to look at given its p= rice of just fractions of a penny per share.=09 To be removed from future mailings, please respond to this email with ""Rem= ove"" in the subject line.

carol.clair@enron.com,"New Draft Jack: Enclosed is a new draft of the Schedules marked against the previous draft. I believe that this draft responds to most of the issues raised in your e-mails. Just a few additional thoughts: 1. Since we will be redoing all of the existing confirms to refer to this Master, I did not change the language that states that conflicts between the Confirms and the Agreement are resolved in favor of the Confirm. I think that the language as written works. 2. On the setoff language, when we are the Non-Defaulting Party, we can only pull in other agreements between our affiliates and inland so I don't see how this language would impact any agreements between ENA and guaranty Bank unless Inland is the Non-Defaulting party. 3. With respect to Disruption Fallbacks, our view is that if the Confirm specifies a Fallback reference Price that after Postponement, you would use that price if available. I think that the language works as drafted. 4. On cash collateral, the Qualified institution concept only applies when the non-posting party is a Defaulting party or has a Credit rating below the threshold. Otherwise the non-posting party can hold the collateral and do whatever it wants to with it. Your are correct that in practice this cash gets commingled with corporate funds and swept into the party's bank account but there is no requirement taht it work that way. We look forward to having a call with your group next week. Please e-mail me with some days and times so that I can alert our people. thanks.

Olandis Gary ca= rried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see! s! ome work at his expense. Michael Westbrook WR WAS Free Agent Update= d 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. O= pposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getti= ng open often after starting the year slowly. Jake Plummer QB ARI Free= Agent Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was inter= cepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who= may not have a better game this season. Michael Pittman RB ARI Road R= age Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushin= g yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless you= r team is very thin at RB.. David Sloan TE DET Free Agent Updated 11/1= 8/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If y= ou are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular lo= oks from Charlie Batch. Lamont Warren RB DET Hatcher's Right Nut Updat= ed 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 pa= sses for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on= third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantas= y backup for the rest of the year. Warrick Dunn RB TB AARP Updated 11/= 18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently g= ood Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic. Keyshawn Johnson WR TB Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11= /18/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he fail= ed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch u= nless your team is very thin at wideout. David Terrell WR CHI Free Age= nt Updated 11/18/01 Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams. M= arty Booker WR CHI Threesome Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passe= s for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has= become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week,= no matter what matchup he faces. Plaxico Burress WR PIT AARP Updated= 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second= -year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player. L= aDainian Tomlinson RB SD The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/18/01 Tomlins= on put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a to= uchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, wh= ich may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason. Hines Ward WR PIT The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/18/01 W= ard caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. While h= e doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh= this year, and he will always post respectable totals. Doug Flutie QB S= D The Internet Potatoes U! pd! ated 11/18/01 Flutie's recent struggles co= ntinued against Oakland, throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he fa= ces a good matchup, starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble. Sta= cey Mack RB JAC Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Mack was held to six rushin= g yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for= the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season. Rich Gannon QB OAK Threeso= me Updated 11/18/01 Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing f= or 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterb= acks in the league and is a must-start every week. Jerry Rice WR OAK = The Flounders Updated 11/18/01 Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eig= ht passes for 131 yards and three touchdowns against San Diego. Rice may no= t be an every-week starter in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still p= ut up huge Fantasy numbers when the matchup is right. Jon Kitna QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Kitna put up 234! y! ards passing and a touch= down against Tennessee, but two interceptions made his performance mediocre= He's no better than a reserve Fantasy player at this point, best used whe= n the matchup is right in a deeper league. Koren Robinson WR SEA Hatc= her's Right Nut Updated 11/18/01 Robinson caught two passes for 15 yards at= Buffalo, including his first career TD, a seven-yarder. Robinson is slowly= improving, but still does not produce enough to be a reliable Fantasy play= er. Corey Dillon RB CIN The Flounders Updated 11/18/01 Dillon was held= in check by Tennessee, rushing for only 38 yards on Sunday. However, with all the injured running backs around the league this season, Dillon is stil= l a must-start on a weekly basis. Steve McNair QB TEN Hatcher's Right= Nut Updated 11/18/01 McNair played despite a sore thumb, throwing for 172 yards and a touchdown against Cincinnati. He's been an unreliable Fantasy p= layer this season, and is worth starting only when the matchup is right. Eddie George RB TEN Hollowman Updated 11/18/01 George was unimpressive once again,! p! osting only 65 scrimmage yards on Sunday against Cincinnati= He just doesn't seem to be at full speed this season, and has been a huge= Fantasy disappointment. Ricky Williams RB NO Road Rage Updated 11/18= /01 Williams had a big game on Sunday, rushing for 120 yards and a touchdow= n against Indianapolis. He continues to prove his value as a Fantasy player= and is a must-start ever week. Aaron Brooks QB NO Road Rage Updated= 11/18/01 Brooks had an outstanding game against Indianapolis, throwing for= 249 yards and two touchdowns. He's put together two straight solid games, and may finally be reaching the potential the coaching staff knew he was ca= pable of. Peyton Manning QB IND Little Bambinos Updated 11/18/01 Mann= ing put up a decent performance against New Orleans, posting 262 yards and a touchdown. He may not be putting up Manning-like numbers this season, but= he's still far too valuable to ever consider benching. Marcus Pollard = TE IND AARP Updated 11/18/01 Poll! ar! d had a huge game on Sunday, catch= ing three passes for 126 yards and a touchdown against New Orleans. He may not be the most consistent Fantasy player, but the lack of tight end depth around the league makes him a valuable commodity. Donovan McNabb QB PHI= AARP Updated 11/18/01 McNabb was unimpressive on Sunday, compiling only 153 scrimmage yards and a touchdown against Dallas. Despite the mediocre pe= rformance, McNabb is still one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the leag= ue. Ryan Leaf QB DAL Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Leaf was horrible fo= r the second straight week, throwing for only 102 yards with two intercepti= ons. Incidently, both picks were returned for touchdowns as Dallas fell to Philadelphia, 36-3. Emmitt Smith RB DAL Little Bambinos Updated 11/18= /01 Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia in the second half with a= n apparent knee injury. He did not return to the game, and finished the day= with 90 scrimmage yards and a fumble.

Californians have a chance to keep the lights on this summer: Let commercial customers take the power they would ordinarily use but decide not to, and sell it back to the grid at a profit. Such ""negawatt"" auctions are already being tested in Atlanta. Wal-Mart, say, could cool down its California stores by an extra three degrees during the nonpeak morning hours. In the afternoon, when temperatures and wholesale power prices soar, it could shut off air-conditioning and resell the power it would have consumed. Stores would be hot, but not unbearable. All Wal-Marts would get to remain open with cash registers operating instead of having to deal with scattershot closings and lost business because of blackouts. From steel fabrication plants to aluminum smelters that have already shuttered for the summer, heavy industry is itching to sell negawatts, says Marc Yacker, spokesman for the Electricity Consumers Resource Council representing industrial users. So why hasn't the Golden State seized a golden opportunity? Governor Gray Davis likes the idea, but not the proponents--Houston energy giants Enron and Reliant Energy--and any suggestion from Texas is, of course, anathema. Another little problem is that California's attorney general is on record favoring jail sentences for energy ""profiteers."" Let a big business like Wal-Mart make a spread on electricity? Horrors! Another hurdle: A multistate auction system of the sort that would rescue California would require overriding the federal Public Utility Holding Company Act, which prevents commercial and residential users from reselling juice to the grid. In Atlanta, where Georgia Power offers large industrial users a program called Daily Energy Credit, the utility was subject to approval only by a state commission, not the Feds, because it runs the negawatt program within its assigned borders and not across state lines. A bill pending in the U.S. House Energy Air Quality subcommittee would have alleviated that. But in June the bill's sponsor, Representative Joe L. Barton, a Republican from Texas, yanked the relief package off the table, claiming House Minority leader Richard Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat, was planning to wreck the deal because it did not promote price caps. Gephardt denies the charge. A shame that it's so much harder to turn down the political heat than the central a/c. Copyright 2000 Dow Jones Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. INDIA: Enron India chief ""optimistic"" about Dabhol project. 07/09/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. NEW DELHI, July 9 (Reuters) The chief executive of Enron Corp's Indian arm said on Monday he was optimistic about working through the company's payment dispute with a local utility. ""There are a variety of options facing us with the project. We are just trying to work through those,"" Wade Cline told reporters in the Indian capital after a meeting with the country's finance secretary. ""We are having good meetings with the ministry, so we are optimistic,"" Cline said. He added he had briefed the finance secretary ahead of Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay's meeting with Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha. Lay is due to meet Sinha, the Indian power minister and senior officials in connection with the payment dispute between Enron's Dabhol Power Co and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board which has defaulted on payments of $48 million to Dabhol. Enron's project is the largest direct foreign investment in India. Its first phase of 740 MW was completed in 1998, while a second phase adding another 1,444 MW was almost complete when its contractor stopped work because of the dispute.

NEW DELHI, July 9 (Reuters) Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay is due to meet the Indian power minister and senior power ministry officials on Monday to discuss a dispute between the U.S. firm's Indian unit and a local utility, officials said. The firm's Dabhol Power Co and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) are locked in a payments dispute which provoked Enron to serve a preliminary termination notice to the utility, which in turn stopped buying power from Dabhol. ""He is scheduled to meet Power Minister Suresh Prabhu at 5:25 p.m. (1155 GMT),"" a federal power ministry official told Reuters. Lay was expected to discuss the future of the troubled Dabhol project, said the official who did not want to be identified. He said Lay would also meet senior officials in the federal power ministry before visiting Prabhu. MSEB, the sole buyer of Dabhol power, has defaulted on payments of $48 million to Dabhol. Enron's project is the largest direct foreign investment in India. Its first phase of 740 MW was completed in 1998, while a second phase adding another 1,444 MW was almost complete when its contractor stopped work because of the dispute.

SANGER 07/08/2001 The New York Times Page 1, Column 5 c. 2001 New York Times Company WASHINGTON WHEN President Bush was sworn in nearly six months ago, Washington was awash with loose talk of a ''C.E.O. presidency.'' The first president with an M.B.A. to his name, from Harvard Business School no less, would be the chairman of the board of the world's biggest conglomerate, his aides boasted, a leader who delegated to his cabinet of experienced C.E.O.'s. They said his administration would apply business discipline to a bloated government. And cabinet sessions do look a lot like the Business Roundtable, the organization of chief executives that, a few weeks ago, held part of its annual meeting in the East Room. Next to the president sits Dick Cheney, late of Halliburton, and Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, fresh from Alcoa. Donald H. Rumsfeld is also at the table, in his second run as defense secretary, after running G. D. Searle Company. Lower level officials, too, look and sound like business folk. ''We effectively are the C.E.O.'s of wholly owned subsidiaries of the Department of Defense,'' said Thomas E. White, who left Enron the Texas energy company that wields great influence here to become secretary of the army last month. But cracks are already beginning to mar the smooth veneer of Bush Co.'s boardroom table. Part of the problem is Mr. Bush himself: He cast himself first as a Reagan-style figure though less detached who would define the missions his team would carry out. But on a host of issues, from energy, to stem cell research, to ending bombing exercises on the island of Vieques in Puerto Rico, Mr. Bush has second-guessed his C.E.O.'s and swept decisions back into the White House. At Bush Co., the strategic plans are beginning to collide, and polls suggest that shareholders are increasingly unconvinced by aspects of the business plan. One cause of the president's troubles may be that his C.E.O. approach to running the government conspicuously lacks what Washington demands: the flexibility required to appeal to a variety of constituencies and to horse trade (something Mr. Bush did quite well in Texas). While Mr. Bush scored a quick, major victory with the tax cut, for example, his energy initiatives and his ''faith-based'' plan for federal aid to religious groups that perform social services have run into the kind of political cross-currents that are rarely seen in corporate America. IN both cases, the White House has shown little willingness to compromise and little ability to persuade voters to share its views. ''They run the meetings on time but he doesn't have much emotional range in connecting these themes to the public,'' said Rahm Emanuel, a highly partisan aide to President Clinton, who never ran meetings on time but knew how to stir a crowd. Mr. Bush's style has also vexed America's allies. They made it clear during his trip to Europe that they are tired of being treated like foreign subsidiaries of America, Inc. So Mr. Bush listened, and said he was humbled. But as soon as he got home, he boasted to The Wall Street Journal that 15 leaders of the European Union ''told me how wrong I was'' on global warming, but that he stood his ground because his position was ''right for America.'' Others say the problem is not Mr. Bush, it's the slowness of his C.E.O.'s to readjust to a world where they do not have the last word. It's a huge change, notes Peter G. Peterson, who moved from a chief executive's post to become commerce secretary in the Nixon administration, and who is now chairman of the Blackstone Group, the New York investment bank. In the private sector, he notes, Mr. Bush's successful former executives had ''the undiffused power to implement their individual corporate visions.'' Not in Washington. ''When you are a C.E.O., you observe, listen, and decide,'' Mr. Peterson said. ''When you are a cabinet secretary, you observe, listen, testify, subject everyone to interagency review, get resistance from Congress, and then, more often than not, someone else decides.'' That should have come as no surprise to Mr. Cheney, Mr. Rumsfeld or Mr. O'Neill, who all had previous experience in government. ''And yet,'' said Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution, ''they seem like somewhere along the line they forgot what they learned, and they've made some severe errors in judgment.'' TAKE Mr. Cheney former Congressman, former White House chief of staff, former defense secretary. To put together the administration's energy report, he drew on the best minds he knew from his life at Halliburton. Yet his reliance on one slice of his constituency his fellow energy executives only fed the perception that the Bush team is far too close to energy interests. Now, in a classic Washington battle, the General Accounting Office is demanding to know who Mr. Cheney met with as his task force developed its policy in secret sessions, and he has refused to reveal the list, fueling suspicions about who has his ear. ''It was less than politically adept,'' one of Mr. Cheney's close friends conceded last week. ''But Dick had strong views, and they were reinforced by others he knew who had similarly strong views.'' Now Mr. Bush is trying to undo the damage, showing up in places like Sequoia National Forest, restoring $300 million in Federal money for energy conservation that Mr. Cheney cut out of the budget, and calling for Americans to use energy efficient devices that Mr. Cheney ignored. Similarly, Mr. Rumsfeld is backtracking from his go-it-alone approach. For months he left the Joint Chiefs in the dark about his missile defense plans, and conducted his top-to-bottom review in secret, with a few trusted aides. ''It was very corporate,'' said one senior military official, ''but we had no idea what he was doing, and he had no idea why we do things the way we do.'' He has begun to change, but some of the Joint Chiefs remain wary of him. Then there is Mr. O'Neill, a longtime friend of Mr. Cheney and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. But it's unclear who is setting financial strategy Mr. O'Neill or the White House chief economic adviser, Larry Lindsey and that has many of America's economic partners unsettled. ''Who makes dollar policy?'' a top aide to Japan's new prime minister asked a reporter last week. So far, it's hard to say. Mr. O'Neill has also shown a penchant for speaking more frankly than the White House would wish. For example, when asked if it was smart to keep pressing for the elimination of the corporate tax at a time the administration is under fire for being too cozy with corporate America, the former Alcoa chief dismissed the whole issue. The corporate tax, he said, ''causes people to say we're getting those rotten bastards who are corporations, and we are taking money away from them.'' But ''at the end of the day individuals pay all the taxes,'' he said, so by cutting taxes for Exxon, I.B.M. and Alcoa, he's really helping consumers. It is not an argument the White House wants to hear right now, and it seems to be looking for another way of doing business. The president is in the midst of what business schools might call a ''strategic refocusing.'' Issues that one might have expected to be decided by the C.E.O.'s have been recalled to the White House. It was Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's political guru, who told the Pentagon that its days of bombing Vieques were coming to an end even though the military has no alternative site to train its fliers. The issue was just too important to Latino voters, or so Mr. Rove thought. Similarly, the coming decision on federal funding for stem-cell research was sucked back into the White House as soon as it became clear that it involved not only science, but Catholics, anti-abortion groups and other key constituencies. Mr. Bush is likely to get into the middle of more decisions. With the surplus shrinking and government revenues declining, Mr. Rumsfeld is trying to figure out how to pay for missile defense and new conventional weapons, while Mr. Cheney wants funding for his energy agenda. AS Mr. Peterson says, ''when the aggregate of these individual visions don't add up, something, and in particular somebody, has to give.'' It's possible that these are the usual contortions any new team finds itself in as it struggles to its feet. But it's also possible that Mr. Bush, eager to apply the lessons of private enterprise to Washington, overestimated how transferable those lessons are. ''The problem isn't the model,'' insists Jeffrey E. Garten, the dean of the Yale School of Management and author of the recent book, ''The Mind of the C.E.O.'' (Perseus, 2001.) ''The problem is the Bush variant of the model. ''A good C.E.O. has to be able to execute the policy once it's set,'' he said. Mr. Bush, like many politicians, is already ''compromising and backpedaling. The C.E.O.'s aren't accustomed to dealing with that. And so they get antsy.''

Mumbai, Jul 8 (PTI) Even as India's western state of Maharashtra grapples over its energy crisis with US energy major Enron, Godbole Review Committee has recommended outright ""privatisation"" of the loss-making Maharashtra electricity board's (MSEB) distribution network and generation unit in the second part of its report to be submitted on July 11. ""The report outlines path breaking reforms, which not only suggests restructuring of MSEB, but also makes its clear that its once-a-very-good board will be destroyed, if it continues as a government body"", official sources told PTI here Sunday. The report would be submitted to the state Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on Tuesday morning, sources said. ""The committee has recommended that MSEB's government ownership should be dissolved, however, the control of transmission network should rest with it"". ""MSEB's current assets are close to worth Rs 120 billion and once cabinet approves the proposal following submission of the report, process like inviting tenders from private parties may be taken up"", officials said. According to the report, the interested companies would have to infuse capital investment in the distribution and generation networks with an increased rate of return at about 4.8 per cent, sources explained. The 200-plus pages report draws a detailed road map for the need to privatise MSEB, a different model from what was implemented in other states, sources added. (THROUGH ASIA PULSE) 08-07 2001 Copyright 2000 Dow Jones Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Tough-talking energy adviser could head state power authority By DANNY POLLOCK Associated Press Writer 07/08/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. LOS ANGELES (AP) With his trademark Stetson hat, cowboy boots and raspy Tennessee drawl, S. David Freeman has seized center stage in California's power crisis. Credited rightly or wrongly for keeping the lights on in Los Angeles as head of the Department of Water and Power, the swashbuckling chief energy adviser to Gov. Gray Davis is seen by many as the state's energy savior. Others, however, call him a wily salesman and master of public relations whose dealings with energy providers are overly confrontational. ""Maybe I'm a little of both,"" the 75-year-old Freeman said. ""I know how to sell a vision."" Indeed, Freeman's record is a conflicted one. He headed the nation's largest municipal utility when it was one of the few power providers in California to avoid the pain of deregulation. He kept the lights on and rates low for the city's 3.8 million residents while pulling the DWP from the brink of bankruptcy. He also was one of the first public officials to talk tough about power generators when energy prices soared, routinely accusing them of committing ""highway robbery"" and ""ripping off"" consumers. Yet Freeman himself has been accused of selling surplus power at premium rates as head of the DWP. His critics also note that Freeman was an early architect of deregulation who helped devise the key mechanisms of the state's energy market, and that he may not deserve the credit he claims for keeping the DWP in control of its own generating plants. Freeman makes no apologies for his record or his aggressive rhetoric. ""It distinguishes me from all the mealy-mouthed wusses who talk in language people don't understand,"" he said. ""It's a tough business we're in. We're not playing pattycake."" Freeman made believers of many state officials while negotiating $43 billion in long-term energy contracts for the state. ""We needed a pirate to negotiate with the pirates,"" said state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Redondo Beach, who chairs the Senate Energy Committee. ""We didn't want to send Snow White."" Freeman is in line to head the newly created state power authority, a key element in his vision for ending the power crisis. The agency can issue up to $5 billion in revenue bonds to build and buy power plants. Freeman's faith in public power goes back to his days growing up in the shadow of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the grandaddy of all public power projects. ""The TVA and religion were the two biggest things in life,"" recalled Freeman, who went to work for the TVA soon after college. In the mid-1960s, he caught the attention of the White House with a major study on energy conservation. President Lyndon Johnson made him the nation's first coordinator of energy policy, a role he maintained under presidents Nixon and Carter. Since then, Freeman has headed four public power agencies, including the TVA. ""David Freeman has an almost religious belief in public power,"" said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents major providers such as Enron, Reliant and Dynegy. ""He really believes that can save the day. But he's flat wrong for California The generation industry, with government stability, will bring new investment."" In the mid-1990s, while Freeman was heading the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, state officials considering deregulation recruited him to oversee development of the Power Exchange and California Independent System Operator. The agencies were to be the cornerstones of deregulation, handling the auctioning of power and managing much of the state's transmission grid. ""I thought deregulation might work,"" Freeman said about the project. ""I wouldn't have done it if I'd have known what would happen."" That turnaround is one of many Freeman has made to dodge the political fallout of deregulation, according to Brian D'Arcy, business manager of Local 18 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents 6,000 municipal utility workers in Los Angeles and other cities. ""He's reinventing history and people aren't calling him on it because they're trying to latch on to his star,"" said D'Arcy, who worked with Freeman after he took over the DWP in 1997. Freeman has been labeled a visionary for bucking deregulation and hanging on to power plants that have since provided a lucrative energy surplus for Los Angeles. D'Arcy said Freeman actually favored selling outdated DWP plants because plenty of cheap power was then available on the spot market. D'Arcy said he fought a sell-off to save jobs for union members. ""He and I fought over (selling) generation, and that stalled it,"" D'Arcy said. Freeman, however, said he intentionally held on to those plants, a move that allowed the DWP to sell excess power and make more than $200 million. He said the agency charged reasonable rates for power under state guidelines, but critics said Freeman's opportunism undercuts his verbal assaults on private generators. ""It's the pot calling the kettle black,"" Smutny-Jones said. ""I don't think it's proper for him to be characterizing everyone else in a negative light."" John Stout, a senior vice president with Reliant Energy, declined to comment specifically about Freeman. However, he said energy providers are being unfairly targeted by accusations of price gouging. ""It's counterproductive,' he said. ""It makes it difficult to sit down face to face to solve problems when someone has their finger in your face.""

By Ebenezer Ademola 07/07/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. LAGOS, July 7 (Reuters) If successful, Nigeria's most ambitious independent power project will be a beacon for other foreign ventures in the country, the head of the project said at the weekend. Dennis Skipper, project manager for AES Barge Nigeria Ltd, the Nigerian subsidiary of the U.S. energy group AES Corp. told Reuters in an interview that many prospective investors based in the U.S. and Europe are watching AES' attempt to generate 270 MW of electricity for Nigeria's power-starved commercial capital Lagos. ""There is a great deal of interest in the United States to invest in Nigeria and the success of this project is going to lead to an economic boom,"" Skipper said. ""Each year people invest in doing things in Nigeria, the risk factor goes down it has a snowball effect and attracts more investors,"" he said. But just in case the political situation in Nigeria, which ended 15 years of military rule in 1999, does turn for the worse, Skipper said AES has taken out a $200 million political risk insurance policy from the U.S.-based Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). ""If somebody seizes power and seizes my (power-generating) barges, I can be paid,"" he said. But after overcoming six months of repeated delays, Skipper said early indications suggest the project will be a success and the company is has large expansion plans. READY TO SEND FIRST ELECTRIC BILL Last month the generating barges positioned next to the country's biggest power plant at Egbin near Lagos began injecting 60 MW into the national grid. Two additional barges are scheduled to be activated July 15, bringing the project up to 120 MW. Skipper said the project should be operating at its full capacity of 270 MW in September. Nigerians have been anxiously watching the barge project in the hope that it they will no longer have to rely solely on the erratic supplies of electricity from the the State-run National Electric Power Authority (NEPA). Africas' most populous country with more than 110 million people, needs about 3,400 MW daily but NEPA's decaying facilities generate only 1,500 MW. Nigerians joke NEPA stands for ""Never Expect Power Always"". At the end of July, AES will send its first monthly bill to NEPA. ""We've given away about $600,000 worth of electricity already,"" Skipper said. He said $270 million has been invested in the project so far and AES is negotiting with NEPA to expand the project by 60 MW to increase the capacity to 330 MW. TWO NEW PROJECTS IN WORKS Skipper said the company is in advanced negotiations with NEPA on two new projects The largest is a 800 MW extension to the Ughelli power plant in Nigeria's oil-rich Delta state. ""We have actually built the engineering model that will be taken,"" he said. ""We have a financial proposal that in principle have been agreed to, all we need to do is finalise the PPA (power purchase agreement)."" The second project is a 548 MW land-based power plant at Agbara, Ogun State, an industrial centre near lagos. When the Nigeria government privatises NEPA next year, Skipper said AES would like to buy the Egbin power plant. ""AES is coming here to stay, we are not just here to make few thousand or few million dollars and go home,"" Skipper said. ""We came here to do business in Nigeria, to be a Nigerian company."" To demonstrate AES's commitment to Nigeria, Skipper said the company is creating a $500,000 education fund, which will provide scholarships and promote education in the country. AES bought majority interest in the barge power project from he original contractor Enron Corp. in December. Nigerian energy firm YF Power Nigeria owns the remaining shares in the business.

NEWS FOCUS ON ENERGY As the clock ticks, rifts remain in Calif. electricity refund talks DAVID IVANOVICH, LAURA GOLDBERG Staff 07/07/2001 Houston Chronicle 3 STAR 1 (Copyright 2001) WASHINGTON California Gov. Gray Davis vowed Friday not to back down on his demands electric power companies cough up $8.9 billion for overcharging the state for electricity in the midst of a power crisis. Negotiators from California and a group of power producers including representatives from Houston-based Reliant Energy, Enron Corp., Duke Energy North America, Dynegy and El Paso Corp. agreed to work through the weekend in the hopes of resolving their refund disputes. But with a Monday deadline fast approaching and the rhetoric still confrontational, the two sides still sounded far from a negotiated settlement. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last month ordered the parties try to reach an agreement. Otherwise, administrative law Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., who is overseeing the negotiations, will craft his own compromise. Wagner had threatened to issue his preliminary terms on Friday, only to back off that warning to give the parties more time to haggle. ""We have several settlement offers pending,"" Reuters quoted Wagner as saying Friday. Wagner added: ""They could meet a consensus in a day or two if they really wanted to."" Tamara Young-Allen, a spokeswoman for the commission, said Wagner is ""very optimistic. The talks are moving along."" But Wagner's optimism is not echoed by other parties at the bargaining table. ""Litigation is basically where we're headed,"" one industry source said early Friday. Davis claims the power companies overcharged the state to the tune of $8.9 billion between May 2000 through May 2001. ""Will I take less than $8.9 billion? No,"" the California governor told reporters Friday. Davis, however, has instructed his negotiators to make clear he is open to several forms of repayments, including renegotiating some existing contracts or contracting for future power at below-market rates. California has been struggling to sign long-term power supply contracts, in an effort to get away from its reliance on the volatile spot market, which left the state's power companies vulnerable to the huge price spikes last winter. As of June 12, the state had signed deals totaling $42.8 billion with 18 different suppliers. As a result, California purchased only 1.9 million megawatt hours of power on the spot market, down from 4 million megawatt hours in May, Davis said. Earlier this week, Davis' chief negotiator in the talks, California Independent System Operator Chairman Michael Kahn, proposed allowing those companies that have signed long-term deals to renegotiate those contracts for lower rates. These discounts could be used to cover the refunds demanded by the state, an industry source said. But Davis said Friday he wants a substantial portion of the $8.9 billion in the form of refunds. The industry source complained that Davis has not been willing to go far enough to reach a settlement. Davis said Friday the state would not be willing to offer to drop ongoing investigations that could result in civil or even criminal penalties as part of those negotiations. Companies from Houston, Oklahoma and North Carolina took advantage of California, Davis said, ""trying to suck us dry."" The power companies, meanwhile, are firing their own salvos. In a report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Friday titled ""Myths Debunked: The Real Story of Wholesale Power Costs in California,"" Reliant assailed the ""disingenuous attempts . to paint the picture that independent generators have been principal beneficiaries of the increase in wholesale power costs in California."" Joe Bob Perkins, president of Reliant Energy's Wholesale Group, argued in an interview that the higher wholesale prices in California were not caused by generators trying to push up their operating margins. Instead, Perkins argued, those prices were the result of a number of factors, including high natural gas prices and a greater reliance on gas-fired power generators because hydroelectric power was short. Reliant's operating margin for its California operations between October 2000 through May 2001 the peak of the power crisis were $41.34 a megawatt hour, the company revealed Friday. This margin which represents the profit for their generating operations per megawatt hour compares with $27.64 per megawatt hour in all of 2000, $11.21 in 1999 and $37.52 in 1998, the company said in its filing. Between 1998 and 2001, the company's fuel costs rose seven-fold while its sales quadrupled, said Reliant, parent company of Houston utilities Reliant HL&P and Reliant Entex. Reliant officials examined which companies collected the $27 billion paid for wholesale power in California last year. More than half the increase in cost, Reliant officials noted, went to California's investor-owned utilities, San Diego Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric, as well as the publicly-owned Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. ""The real money stayed in California itself,"" Reliant said in its filing. Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a trade association of wholesale power buyers and sellers in the Western states, argued that ""if the state of California insists on its fictitious number of $8.9 billion, that won't help the negotiations any,"" he said. If the parties fail to reach an agreement, Wagner will have one week to devise his own settlement plan and present that recommendation to the full Energy Regulatory Commission. He said the talks would likely continue up to the midnight Monday deadline. ""Three minutes before closing time is when the most serious negotiations take place,"" he said. Mug: California Gov.

alan.comnes@enron.com," Dynegy-Enron Deal Faces Significant Reg Review By Bryan Lee 11/08/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones Company, Inc.) OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Any merger deal that may emerge between Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Enron Corp. (ENE) will face a complicated and time-consuming regulatory-review process, legal experts said Thursday. Any equity deal would require approvals from numerous U.S. federal regulatory agencies and state utility regulators, as well as survive Canadian and European antitrust reviews, energy attorneys contacted by Dow Jones Newswires said. A merger would require approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission. And the Illinois Commerce Commission likely would weigh into the mix, since Dynegy owns Illinova's Illinois Power Co. Any effort to strike a deal quickly also could be complicated by Enron's ownership of Portland General Electric Co. While Enron has entered into an agreement to sell the utility to Northwest Natural Gas Co. (NWN), a previous attempt to sell the company fell through because of regulatory complications. A key issue for federal regulators scrutinizing a potential Enron-Dynegy merger will be the degree of electricity market concentration such a transaction would entail, the attorneys said. Financially wounded Enron is the nation's largest electricity and natural gas trader with an extensive network of gas pipelines. Dynegy is ranked sixth nationally in both electricity and natural gas marketing. The transaction would receive the greatest scrutiny at FERC, where the merger application would challenge the commission's merger-review policy, attorneys said. Racing Against The Liquidity Clock ""Enron is a complicated beast,"" and an acquisition by Dynegy likely would ""stretch FERC's limits of market-power review,"" one legal expert said. The primary question the commission will consider is whether combining the companies will increase market concentration in wholesale power markets to an unacceptable level. Also, FERC is in the process of changing the basis upon which it authorizes electricity sales at market-based rates, which could pose complications for a combined Enron-Dynegy down the road. According to Platts Power Markets Week, Enron's market share in competitive power markets is nearly 15%, while Dynegy's is pushing 5%. That makes the combined market share perilously close to the 20% threshold of concern under antitrust review. But FERC will undertake a more complicated analysis than that, looking at both vertical and horizontal market power, attorneys said. On a horizontal basis, there likely won't be much concern at FERC. Enron owns few hard generating assets compared to Dynegy, although FERC will scrutinize generation assets that Enron doesn't own but controls the output of on a contractual basis. It is in the vertical market power analysis where FERC's merger review gets truly complicated. The commission will assess to what degree the combination of Enron's pipelines including one that controls 23% of natural gas imported from Canada and Dynegy's portfolio of electric generation assets present competitive concerns. While Dynegy's pipeline holdings are far smaller than Enron's, it does have some upstream natural gas processing and gathering assets that FERC could view as problematic. Never before has FERC encountered a vertical market power analysis of such scale and scope before, legal experts agreed. Another aspect of the deal that will interest FERC, according to one attorney, is Enron's Internet-based trading platform, EnronOnline, through which 25% of wholesale power sales are traded. FERC has traditionally only looked at hard assets, but in recent weeks has indicated it intends to take a harder look at financial assets when considering market power issues. But even if FERC doesn't take on the issue, the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission certainly will when considering the antitrust aspects of the combination. ""These two companies are huge commodity traders. Oftentimes they're trading in commodities that have nothing to do with energy,"" noted one attorney. Antitrust agencies will scrutinize whether the combination could present market power concerns for nonenergy-related commodities as well as electricity and natural gas. As if the complicated market-power reviews by FERC and antitrust agencies weren't enough, the deal also must pass muster at the Securities and Exchange Commission under the 1935 Public Utility Holding Company Act. The Depression-era law restricts the geographic scope and nonenergy business holdings of multistate utility holding companies. Dynegy is an exempt holding company under the act, since its utility holding is confined to one state. It would have to register under the law and potentially divest assets to garner SEC approval as long as Enron still holds Portland General Electric, attorneys agreed. The SEC review also is complicated by the 26% stake in Dynegy held by ChevronTexaco (CVX). That investment was structured in a highly complex manner to avoid triggering regulation under the 1935 holding company act, according to a lawyer familiar with the deal. Dynegy could structure the deal in several different ways in order to sidestep holding company act restrictions, according to a leading legal expert on the law. Dynegy could take nonvoting or preferred stock with conversion rights contingent on Enron's selling the Oregon utility, the attorney said. ""There are ways to structure it short of a stock-for-stock deal, which is what most people think about."" Given the race against the clock driven by Enron's increasingly perilous liquidity crunch, such an investment sidestepping regulatory review may be the way the companies have to go in the near term. ""It's a run on the bank,"" the holding company act expert said. A Wall Street analyst suggested that, given Enron's predominance in energy markets, concerned Washington regulators and politicians may choose to expedite the deal. ""Enron going down on the verge of winter is not a good thing,"" the analyst said. ""They may be more lenient if they can put a frigging tourniquet on Enron."" -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; Bryan.Lee@dowjones.com Copyright 2000 Dow Jones Company, Inc.

neilanderson@lists.crosswalk.com,"Neil Anderson Devotional for Saturday, October 27, 2001 If you are looking to feed and challenge your faith, visit Crosswalk.com's Spiritual Life Channel at: <URL> N E I L A N D E R S O N D A I L Y D E V O T I O N A L from Freedom in Christ Ministries October 27 FORGIVING YOUR PAST Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you (Ephesians 4:32). The second step in resolving past conflicts is to forgive those who have offended you. After encouraging Cindy, a rape victim, to deal with the emotional trauma of her rape, I said, ""Cindy, you also need to forgive the man who raped you."" Cindy's response was typical of many believers who have suffered physical, sexual or emotional pain at the hands of others: ""Why should I forgive him? You don't know how badly he hurt me!"" ""He's still hurting you, Cindy,"" I responded. ""Forgiveness is how you stop the pain. You don't forgive him for his sake; you do it for your sake."" Why should you forgive those who have hurt you in the past? First, forgiveness is required by God. As soon as Jesus spoke the amen to His model prayer--which included a petition for God's forgiveness--He commented: ""If you forgive men for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions"" (Matthew 6:14, 15). We must base our relationships with others on the same criteria on which God bases His relationship with us: love, acceptance and forgiveness (Matthew 18:21-35). Second, forgiveness is necessary to avoid entrapment by Satan. I have discovered from my counseling that unforgiveness is the number one avenue Satan uses to gain entrance to believers' lives. Paul encouraged mutual forgiveness ""in order that no advantage be taken of us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes"" (2 Corinthians 2:11). Unforgiveness is an open invitation to Satan's bondage in our lives. Third, we are to forgive like Christ forgave in order to keep our hearts from bitterness. Paul wrote: ""Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. And be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you"" (Ephesians 4:31, 32). Your act of forgiveness will set the captive free, then you will realize that the captive was you! Lord, teach me to forgive others from my heart as You have forgiven me.

ca5_public_event_note@ca5.uscourts.gov,"U. S. Court of Appeals Fifth Judicial Circuit: Event Notification System. ANNOUNCING THE EVENT NOTIFICATION SYSTEM Because we have your e-mail address, we are TESTING a system which offers you the opportunity to receive automatic e-mail notification of certain events taking place in your 5th Circuit appeals. In brief, we send you an e-mail notifying you when we: 1. Issue a briefing notice; 2. File and rule on motions to extend the time to file a brief, or to suspend briefing times; 3. File briefs; 4. File and act on a petition for rehearing. You can see a complete listing of the notification events by clicking on the link below. <URL> What does the notice look like? You receive the publicly available docket text for these events from our automated case processing system. You can see a sample by clicking on the link below. This is the ONLY information you receive. You still have to access PACERNET to view the entire docket sheet. For those events where we normally send you a paper document, e.g. a briefing notice, you will still receive that paper notice. What is the benefit to me? You will save time and money by not having to check your case's status on PACERNET, and will not have to call our office to see if we have filed your or your opponent's brief, to find out when your briefing time begins to run, or if a rehearing petition has been filed, etc. This service is designed to benefit you and our office. If however, we find that we are expending more resources by operating the event notification system because we receive more telephone calls or electronic messages etc. we will discontinue the service. How much does the event notification service cost? The service is free. How do I sign up for the service? You must: 1. Be a member of the 5th Circuit Bar; 2. Have provided us your current e-mail address; 3. Sign up by clicking on the link below and filling out the required information, or by going to our website <URL> and clicking on the ""event notification"" link. Note, that you can elect to start the service now, delay receiving the service, but be left on our invitation list, or elect not to participate and be removed from our invitation list. You can also change your e-mail address and this will change it throughout our automated system. <URL> What if I want to stop the service? You can discontinue the service at any time by selecting the ""event notification link"" or our ""website"", entering your social security number and then selecting the either of the options that de-register you from the service. What if the court needs to stop the service? This is a test service. If we find that running the event notification program strains our limited resources, we may terminate the test. ",1

soblander@carrfut.com,"(00-421)Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading NYMEX ACCESS Notice No. 00-421 December 12, 2000 MEMORANDUM TO: ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff Executive Vice President DATE: December 12, 2000 RE: Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; The purpose of this Notice is to remind Members and Member Firms that an Executive Committee Resolution that was ratified by the Board of Directors and that concerns Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; (Resolution), remains in effect and will continue until February 1, 2001, unless Members are notified otherwise by the Exchange. As background, on October 6, 2000, the Exchange issued a Notice to Members (#347), advising Members and Member Firms that the CFTC had approved this Resolution. The Resolution, which became effective with the commencement of the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session on Sunday, October 8, 2000, has amended on a temporary basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;. The Resolution is included below. The Resolution was issued so as to ensure the successful reimplementation of the new implied order functionality on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;. By significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to trading activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;, the Resolution reduces the possibility that a price limit would be triggered by the implied functionality. The Resolution amends, on a temporary basis, Exchange price fluctuation limit rules but only with respect to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;. Thus, the new price limits that went into effect last week for Natural Gas are further expanded as provided by the terms of the Resolution. The Resolution amends the Exchange's price fluctuation limit rules with regard to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; in four ways: (1) The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits) are expanded to 200% of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contract months for energy contracts, or to the first contract month with limits in effect for metals contracts, of that futures contract under the applicable rule. (2) This expanded limit (e.g., 200% of the limits for the front two months for energy contracts) is applicable to all contract months for that futures contract. (3) In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer, trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; generally would be halted immediately, rather than requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes. During the last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session, the market would be halted only far as long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price limits. (4) As a clarification, the Resolution suspends use of certain ""haircuts"" narrowing price limits based on notional settlement prices. Specifically, NYMEX Rule 6.56 (Settlement Prices and Price Fluctuation Limits for NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;) establishes the use of notional settlement prices as the base point for price limits (until the actual settlement prices from the RTH session can be input into the system.) NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; will continue to use such notional settlement prices under the Resolution. However, Rule 6.56 reduces applicable price limits by certain specified percentages during the period when notional settlement prices are used as the base point for establishing limits. Such ""haircuts"" are not being used under the Resolution; the Exchange will resume use of such haircuts following the expiration of the Resolution. Finally, the Resolution also clarifies one aspect of existing Exchange practice. In the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; traded for five minutes at a price fluctuation limit applicable to Regular Trading Hours (RTH) trading, then the RTH session would open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule. This practice will continue to be followed during the period when the Resolution is in effect, even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading during the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; trading session because the market had not hit the expanded limits applicable only to NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;. As noted, these temporary amendments to the Exchange's price limits shall expire on February 1, 2001, unless Members are notified otherwise by the Exchange. If you have any questions, please contact Stu Homler, Director, NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; Operations, NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; Department, at (212) 299-2754, Matt Morano, NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; Department, at (212) 299-2679, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207. APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby Resolves that, until further notice, the price fluctuation limit rules for each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc: The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits) shall be expanded to 200% of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the applicable rule. This expanded limit (200% of the limits for the first two months with limits) shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract. In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low price fluctuation limit, trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately except as directed otherwise by the President or the President's designee. Following resumption of trading, the price limits in effect shall be 200% of the limits applicable to RTH trading. In the event that a limit is touched during the last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session, the market shall be halted briefly, and price limits shall be expanded thereafter In addition, in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded for five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session at a price fluctuation limit applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session, then the RTH session shall open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule, even though no temporary cessation of trading occurred during the NYMEX ACCESSc trading session.

bjones5@txu.com,"A little Ancillary Services Parable As I had a little difficulty expressing my concerns today, I thought that I might offer you a little parable. One day, an enterprising young boy named Bubba decided to start a lemonade stand in front of his house so that he could afford to buy a GI Joe with the kung fu grip. He set up a table, painted a sign that read ""Lemonade 25 cents"", and began to squeeze lemons. Bubba discovered that he could squeeze enough lemons for about 10 glasses of lemonade each hour. Bubba had a bothersome little five year old brother named Scooter. Although annoying to Bubba, Scooter loved to do whatever Bubba was doing and decided to set up another lemonade stand right next to his brother's stand. Scooter was not as strong as Bubba and could only squeeze enough lemonade for about 8 glasses each hour. Scooter also painted a sign that read ""Lemonade 25 cents"". Initially, the two boys could sell about 8 glasses of lemonade each hour between the two of them, but as the weather got hotter they attracted more and more thirsty customers. Eventually, they were selling about 15 glasses of lemonade each hour.* As it got hotter and baseball season began, the boys grew less interested in their stands and the GI Joe with the kung fu grip was not getting any closer. Then, Bubba got an idea. if he raised his price to 30 cents a glass, he would make a lot more money. The customers at first would buy their lemonade from Scooter but when he ran out they would buy it from Bubba. This worked great for Bubba but Scooter did not like his brother making more money for the same lemonade. Because he liked to do whatever his brother was doing, and because he also had his mind set on buying a three foot plastic alligator with the remote action chompers and realistic sounds, he too raised his price by 5 cents. Regardless of the new higher price, the customers kept coming. ""Hey, this is great"" the two brothers thought to themselves. But then, the good times came to a halt. Bubba's mom discovered that he was charging 30 cents for a glass of lemonade and she ordered him to drop his price back to 25 cents (but not before she bored him about how lemonade had only cost a nickel in her day)**. Interestingly, she must have forgotten to tell Scooter to do the same (Bubba always suspected that she liked Scooter better anyway). So, Bubba hatched a new plan. If he could get Scooter to sell his lemonade for him, he could still receive the higher price the customers were paying***. Thus, Bubba began making lemonade for Scooter's stand. Bubba kept his stand open but he never had any lemonade to sell. Soon a long line set up in front of Bubba's stand, all eager to buy out his cheaper lemonade. But some of the kids became frustrated and angry when Bubba was not selling any lemonade at his mom's ordered price. Buzzer, the neighborhood snitch, told Bubba's mother what he was doing and she was not pleased. She told Bubba ""young man, I want you to go out there and sell lemonade for 25 cents to whoever asks for it, or else""! Fearing for his young life, and knowing that he could not possibly squeeze enough lemons to make all 15 glasses, Bubba made Scooter an ""offer he could not refuse"". He told Scooter that he was taking the unsold lemonade from Scooter's stand and would pay him only 20 cents****. Then, Bubba could sell Scooter's lemonade to the thirsty crowd and still meet the demand while staying out of mom's dog house. Unfortunately, Scooter realized that this was more hassle than he had expected and went inside to play Nintendo leaving Bubba with the angry crowd and not enough lemonade to sell. Bubba has now become a pivotal supplier of lemonade. Bubba's mom has just intervened in his market with a price adjustment. Bubba moves his supply to the unrestrained market. Scooter's lemonade has just been OOMed. Whenever two markets are perfect substitutes for each other, market forces will bring the prices into equilibrium through the execution of arbitrage opportunities. Yet, when the price in one of the two markets is artificially managed, this equilibrium cannot exist. It would be expected that the market that is price managed will attract more buyers but less suppliers. If suppliers are not forced to participate in the price managed market, then they will shift their supply to the market without price controls and buyers will have to follow. This would mark the end of the price controlled market leaving only one market remaining. On the other hand, if the price controlled market also can force suppliers to deliver into its market, then the buyers would not have to follow the supply. In fact, in this case, more buyers would shift to the price controlled market if it was perceived to deliver lower prices than the free market. In this case, demand dries up in the free market and suppliers are forced into the price managed market. Yet, suppliers must be paid for this forced sale and a regulated price is developed to accomplish a fair compensation. Thus, relieving us all of the complexities of this thing called competition.

donald.black@enron.com,"Entergy peaker in Entergy Team, I finally got a chance to talk to Entergy about their merchant peaker in their own service territory. Specifics are as follows: Configuration: 4 x GE 7EA's at 72 73 MW each because of elevation and humidity levels. Location: Vicksburg, MS sharing a site with the Baxter Wilson plant (1320 MW coal/gas fired boiler) HHV: 12,200 btu/kwh Pipe: A new intra-state that will be shared with the Baxter Wilson plant. Existing sources are Koch and Duke. Start date: 7/01 Permits: PSD permit at 9 ppm. No run hour limitation. Taxes: Fee in lieu of taxes at 1/3 cost for first ten years. Full property taxes thereafter. Entergy claims this is the same deal Ben Jacoby got for our peaker in MS. First we need to model a pro-forma of plant operating costs using estimates of FOM and VOM from internal sources. Second, we need to calculate spread option valuations of the underlying plant for 20-years using curve, vol and correlation assumptions acceptable to the desk. Thirdly and based on 20-year plant valuations, I need to create a debt service schedule. Finally, we have to price the put option premium and sensitivities using the research/structuring model.

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz The game's afoot for software specialist Activision (Nasdaq: ATVI). The popular video game maker trounced analyst estimates like a Quake baddie in one of its console ports. <URL> Earnings more than quadrupled to $0.17 a share, a stunning eight cents above Wall Street projections. Revenues climbed by 25% to $144.4 million with the peak holiday shopping season right around the corner. But, as we noted last week, delays in mass shipments of the highly anticipated PlayStation 2 might hose down some of that red-hot momentum with the video game powerhouses. Without enough systems to meet seasonal demand, and few gamers willing to stockpile games for platforms on the way out, how will Activision perform? <URL> The company is now hiking its annual bottom-line forecast by seven cents to $0.63 a share. The only problem is that the company used up eight of those upwardly revised coppers this past quarter. That means that the game maker is looking to fall a penny short in either the December or March reporting period. That might happen later rather than sooner. Since mid-September the company's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 has been the top-selling title for the top-selling PlayStation system. While we are now just two days away from the PlayStation 2 launch, the extreme skating title should continue to roll along nicely in the near term. Activision the subject of StockTalk last April is the country's second-largest developer of game console software, behind only Electronic Arts (Nasdaq: ERTS). The company is looking for flat growth over the year ahead but a 50% spike come calendar year 2002. <URL> So the past looks great. The long-term appears equally aglow. It's the near-term that might have investors fumbling for the pause button. _________________________________________________________________ NEWS TO GO Winning the battle but Lucent (NYSE: LU) the war, the telecommunications titan reported earnings of $0.18 a share, a penny above estimates. The problem? Analysts were looking for a $0.29 showing before the company gave Wall Street downward guidance due to soft equipment sales. That prompted the bar being lowered to a height of $0.17 a share. Over the weekend, the company's board of directors fired its CEO. Reserve the right to do the same to anyone who naively tells you that Lucent is back on track because it topped fourth-quarter projections. <URL> <URL> Twenty-five million Welcomes. This morning America Online (NYSE: AOL) announced that it reached the 25 million subscriber mark for its namesake online service. It was simply a matter of time and of scatter software marketing since the company had announced that it had 24.6 million users at the end of the September quarter. On the merger front, today's Wall Street Journal is reporting that the review deadline for its Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) acquisition has been extended by two weeks. The stateside antitrust authorities continue to ponder the ramifications of the mega media merger. National Semiconductor (NYSE: NSM) is laying its chips on the table and the stock is falling as it may. The company has warned that its second and third quarters might fall short of its fiscal first-quarter showing. The company earned $0.76 a share on $640 million in revenues for the period. It was another ""pfine"" quarter for Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). The pharmaceuticals powerhouse reported earnings of $0.27 a share on revenues of $7.2 billion. The results came in two cents ahead of expectations. For the year, the company is comfortable with targets of $30 billion in revenue and $1.01 a share in earnings.

kelly@erienet.net,"Ken would you help us? We need a utility/energy company referral. We are an early stage e-commerce company that offers the world's largest selection of wildlife merchandise. We are ready to obtain our first round of financing. We would like to have 5 co-branding partners who would receive equity positions in our company. We would incorporate their logo throughout our site and include their PR materials with each order shipped. Target partners would include the utility and energy companies. Since your company is active in this market, you may know of someone who can assist us. We see utility/energy companies as a compatable fit because of their interest in projecting a positive wildlife/environmental image. About our company: WildlifeCollectibles.Com is a specialty catalog company featuring wildlife merchandise. We have the world's largest selection of wildlife merchandise. Currently in the wildlife merchandise niche there are no entities offering broad merchandise selections for each animal specie. We are filling this void by operating 22 ""sub-niche"" stores under the WildlifeCollectibles.Com brand. These 22 storefronts will represent 105 wildlife species. Seven of these storefronts are operational and the backend inventory systems are complete for the other 15. We are in the process of loading them on the Internet. One major component not yet installed on our site is our ""Facts About the Specie"" page. We will have reference information available for every wildlife specie listed on our site. At present, there is no central repository of reference material available for most species. Britanica.com has reference information available for only 11 species. This will attract school age children with their parents tagging along. We are looking for a total of 5 million dollars. In order to assist companies in purchasing an equity position/co-branded arrangement with us, we are willing to finance their investment. We will take $25,000.00 a month for 40 months from 5 corporate partners. This will allow them to budget the expense through Public Relations or Marketing. I hope I have given you enough information to understand what we would like to do, so you can either assist us or point us in the right direction. We would pay a commission and provide a small equity stake in our company to the individual who signs on the utility/energy companies for us.

It was great getting to know you, and to see how you're going to use e.Planning to help proactively manage your business. Clearly you're going to push the envelope in ways we haven't seen clients go before... a tribute to the innovativeness of Enron and its people! Its great to think that our software is going to really make a difference in how you're employing information and involving people in your planning processes going forward. Thanks for all your support, and I look forward to a strong and lasting partnership with you and your teams! Don't hesitate to ever call if there's anything I can do for you. As a little aside, I sent along a great slide show chronicling your floods a few weeks back. I am sure you've seen these already, but if not, the pictures are pretty awesome! Mark/Jan, I will be working up a proposal on the P.R. front after the Fourth holiday week has passed. I will be curious to hear if/how your preliminary discussions with the P.R. team progressed. I think we can do some great things that will further Enron's ""most innovative"" image using business planning as a platform. More to come! And yes, Mark, we will get our racquets warmed up during our next visit. I must say however, your recent match with a Wimbledon Master has me just a bit daunted right now.

dsalter@hgp-inc.com,"Various Rika, Just to let you know a couple of things: 1. The NRC (Chairman Meserve's executive assistant) called us specifically today to let us know the daily plant status was back. However, they said t= hey are still in a test mode and the data may not all be there and what's t= here may not all be accurate. They are still working toward having everyth= ing up and rolling perfect by the end of the month (although it seems they will improve on that target). 2. The Indian Point 2 meeting was about what we expected. The NRC has a li= ttle more confidence in the way Entergy is proceeding than it had in Con Ed= ison. However, IP2 remains the only plant in the country with multiple deg= raded cornerstones in the NRC's reactor oversight process, and is still wea= k in several of those areas including: Design Configuration Control, Human Performance, Equipment Reliability, Emergency Preparedness, and Corrective Actions. One of the major disadvantages that Entergy has with IP2 is its l= ocation in the Northeast (Anti-nuke country). There were more than 120 peo= ple at the meeting, of which about half were general public. The public wa= s not friendly and voiced complaints and protests against the quality of op= eration. While this of itself will not hurt Entergy's operation efforts, i= t does bear heavily on the NRC's attitude toward the plant. The NRC does n= ot want to be embarrassed as it has in the past (most notably with Millston= e). If Entergy loses ground in their recovery efforts especially in the ar= ea of security, the NRC will step in to take more drastic action. Dan",1

aroffwarg@bracepatt.com,"Ben, Thanks for your email. I have highlighted the pertinent Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of the Project Development Agreement to the bottom of this email for your review So long as we extend the May 1, 2001 date to August 1, 2001 regarding Purchaser's obligations, I think many of your concerns are adequately covered by these Sections. This was a big concern of Healy's when we did the deal initially and we tried to make it clear that, despite a sale of the Interests to AES prior to the deadline for meeting the Development Milestones, Developer (ENA) would remain the exclusive developer of the Property as long as the PDA was in effect. Regarding indemnities, in Section 6.11, Purchaser agrees to indemnify Developer and Developer's related parties from all damages caused by Purchaser's nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant under the PDA. Thus, if they breach the obligations listed below, they are liable to us for damages related to such breach. Please call me at your convenience to discuss this issue at your convenience. Best regards. SECTION 2.2 Obligations of Purchaser. Purchaser shall have the following obligations under this Project Development Agreement: (a) Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Developer in achieving the Development Milestones on or before [May 1, 2001]; (b) Purchaser shall pay to Developer all payments owing by Purchaser to Developer in accordance with Article III below, as and when such payments are due; (c) Purchaser agrees to provide on or before fifteen (15) days after the Effective Date the Base Configuration Information; (d) following Purchaser's submission to Developer of the Base Configuration Information, Purchaser hereby agrees not to change any of the information contained in the Base Configuration Information in any manner that could, in Developer's reasonable judgment, adversely affect Developer's ability to achieve the Development Milestones; (e) Purchaser agrees (i) not to take any action that is reasonably likely to hinder, impede or delay Developer's achievement of the Development Milestones or that could make Developer's achievement of such Development Milestones more costly and (ii) to use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly supply to Developer follow-up information that is consistent with the Base Configuration Information which is reasonably requested by Developer (or any Governmental Authority) in connection with Developer's pursuit of the Development Milestones; (f) Purchaser recognizes that, except as otherwise provided in Section 3.7, Developer is the exclusive developer of the Project; provided, that Developer agrees to include representatives of Purchaser in all material meetings and discussions with third parties related to the development of the Project, including all material discussions and meetings with respect to the TVA Interconnection Agreement and related matters. (g) in the event Purchaser purchases the Interests prior to the termination of this Project Development Agreement, all of Purchaser's obligations pursuant to this Project Development Agreement (including 2.2(f)) shall continue in full force and effect and Purchaser agrees to cause the Company (and any subsequent purchasers and assignees of the Company) to comply with all restrictions set forth in this Section 2.2(e)-(f) as if the Company (including any subsequent purchaser or assignee) and the Purchaser were the same entity. SECTION 2.3 Miscellaneous. (a) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(f) above but specifically subject to Section 2.2(e), (i) following Purchaser's purchase of the Interests, Purchaser may hold itself out as the ""owner"" of the Interests so long as Purchaser does so in a manner that does not adversely affect Developer's ability to achieve the Development Milestones and (ii) prior to Purchaser's purchasing of the Interests, Purchaser may have direct contact with Purchaser Contact Parties as reasonably necessary in connection with the Project so long as (x) prior to any such contact each Purchaser Contact Party has executed a confidentiality agreement in a form reasonably approved by Developer and (y) all such contacts and any agreements with any Purchaser Contact Party are made by Purchaser only on behalf of Purchaser (and specifically not the Company or Developer). (b) Notwithstanding anything stated herein to the contrary, Purchaser agrees not to enter into any agreement with any third party on behalf of the Company or otherwise bind the Company without the prior written consent of Developer which may be granted or withheld by Developer in its sole discretion. Purchaser agrees to defend and indemnify Developer and the Company against any Damages suffered by Developer or the Company related to any agreement or alleged agreement entered into between the Company and any third party in violation of this Section 2.3(b). The indemnification described in the previous sentence shall expressly survive the termination of this Project Development Agreement. (c) Purchaser agrees that all information it provides to Developer or any third party in connection with the Haywood Site, the Project, or the Company (i.e. information provided to regulatory authorities regarding air permit related matters) will be factually correct in all material respects.

Roffwarg Bracewell Patterson, LLP South Tower Pennzoil Place 711 Louisiana St. Houston, Texas 77002 (713) 221-1117 (Ph) (713) 221-2184 (Fax) CONFIDENTIALITY STATEMENT: This information is intended only for the use of the individual or entity to which it is addressed and may contain information that is privileged, confidential, and/or exempt from disclosure under applicable law.

Thank you. <Ben.F.Jacoby@enron.com> 05/01/01 07:24PM Aaron: It is highly likely that AES would exercise their early purchase option in May. As such, I want to make sure we are thinking about the duties, obligations, and indemnities among the parties under the circumstance that AES owns the member interests in Haywood, and ENA is continuing its efforts to achieve the milestone of the interconnection agreement through August 1. I also want to make sure we have adequate indemnities from AES regarding actions we will undertake to achieve the interconnection milestone. At the end of the day, ENA will be focused on two things: (i) causing TVA to lower its Network Upgrade estimate from the current level of $4.8 million, and (ii) causing TVA to produce an interconnection agreement in substantially the same form as the Gleason interconnect agreement. Obviously, with AES owning the Haywood member interests and being in the driver's seat, they will play a key role in whether these two items are achieved. I want to make sure that the same standards which applied to us prior to them exercising their early option (i.e. we were on the hook to use reasonable commercial efforts to achieve the milestones) now applies to them during the period that we are still trying to achieve the milestones. With Stuart's concurrence, I'd like you to further review the documents and make a recommendation as to what other changes, if any, we should make, to protect our upside under the circumstance described above. Thanks, Ben ""Aaron Roffwarg"" <aroffwarg@bracepatt.com> on 05/01/2001 06:49:19 PM ",1

Bush filed suit in federal court today, seeking to prevent Santa Claus from making his list and then checking it twice. The complaint seeks an immediate injunction against the beloved Christmas icon, asking the court to effectively ban his traditional practice of checking the list of good boys and girls one additional time before packing his sleigh. The suit filed in Federal District Court in Austin, asks a federal judge to ""hereby order Mr. Claus to cease and desist all repetitive and duplicative list-checking activity, and certify the original list as submitted without amendment, alteration, deletion, or other unnecessary modification."": There are no standards for deciding who is naughty, and who is nice. It's totally arbitrary and capricious. How many more time does he need to check? This checking, checking and re-checking over and over again must stop now,"" said former Secretary James Baker Baker further claimed that unnamed GOP observers witnessed an elf remove all boys named Justin from the 'nice' list, filing them under 'naughty' instead because ""everyone knows all boys named Justin are brats."" Gov. Bush cited the potential for unauthorized list tampering, blasted what he called the ""crazy, crazy mess up there at the North Pole."" ""Their security is really awful, really bad,"" said Bush. ""My mother just walked right in, told 'em she was Mrs. Claus. They didn't check her ID or nothing."" Meanwhile, Dick Cheney, issued a direct plea to St. Nick himself. ""Mr. Claus, I call on you to do the honorable thing, and quit checking your list. The children of the world have had enough. They demand closure now."" Cheney said, adding that his granddaughter has already selected a name for the pony she's asked for. The Rev. Jesse Jackson was quick to respond to the latest development with plans to lead his protesters from Florida to the North Pole via dogsled. The ""Million Man Mush!"" is scheduled to leave Friday. ""We need red suits and sleighs, not law suits and delays,"" Jackson said. Santa Claus could not be reached for comment, but spokeself said he was ""deeply distressed"" by news of the pending legal action against him. ""He's losing weight, and he hasn't said 'Ho Ho Ho' for days,"" said the spokeself. ""He's just not feeling jolly."" ",1
