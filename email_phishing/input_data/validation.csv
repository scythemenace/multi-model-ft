I have not requested contributions in school board races since our PAC funds are limited. (Another Enron employee asked for $1000 PAC contribution for someone he was personally supporting for school board.) Elizabeth Linnell gathered some historical data regarding PAC contributions to education candidates: The PAC made contributions to the following organizations in 1997 and 1999 at $1,000 in each case: Houston Citizens for Better Education Houston Friends for Better Education Houston Parents for Better Education Houston Taxpayers for Better Education In 1995 the PAC gave $500 to Lori Becker, a school board candidate. Joe said that Pat Rosenberg has $20,000 in her campaign fund and he is trying to help her get more money in, as soon as possible, to get her numbers up.

arusiagbara@yahoo.com,"CAN YOU HELP ME? Doug Gilbert-Smith FROM Dr Arusi Agbara. AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT. FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT. AFRICAN INTERNATIONAL BANK. LOME-TOGO. TEL:00228-911-40-37. FAX:00228-222-45-84 DEAR, (CONFIDETIAL PLEASE) I am Dr Arusi Agbara, chief accountant for the bills and credits in the foreign remittance dept. section of African International Bank Lome-Togo in west Africa with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditting in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on november 1992 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development. Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself and partner to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was $6,500,000.00usd(six million five hundred thousand united states dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through my good friends who works with chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here in Lome-Togo. It is him who recommended your person to me to be viable and capable to champion a business of such magnitude without any problem Meanwhile all the whole arrangements to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into, on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account. I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and fax bills, while 60% will be for me and my partner. Please, you have been adviced to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account. and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentage. previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible, stating your wish in this deal. Yours faithfully, Dr.Arusi Agbara.

zljp06a@prodigy.com,"DTMI: TOP STOCK PICK 152662 Our last pick, SYGE has returned more than 30% since December 19th. Today's company looks like an even bigger winner. OTC Investor Dtomi, Inc. (OTC.BB: DTMI) January 09, 2002 The Bear Market appears to have ended and the market has tested important support levels. Recently the NASDAQ has rallied to over 2000, and the DOW has rallied to over 10,000. The accumulation/distribution indicators have turned extremely positive, meaning institutions and mutual funds have started buying stocks. We believe it is time for investors to get back into the market. Our next recommendation, Dtomi, Inc. (OTC.BB:DTMI), could be one of our top picks of the year. For this reason we here are giving DTMI our highest rating of Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth. Stock Symbol: DTMI Shares Outstanding: 15,400,000 Float (estimated): 2,500,000 (estimated) Rating: Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth Current Price: $2.00 Target Price: $7.50 About the Company DTMI is a technology company that turns data into market intelligence. DTMI combines very sophisticated proprietary software that intelligently researches every aspect of business to business databases for company information, products and manufacturing capacity. DTMI utilizes these proprietary databases to create algorithms that compile and sell high-demand corporate intelligence and marketing information. DTMI's combination of technology and expertise quickly identifies new markets and prospects for client's marketing departments. According to DTMI's management, the company has become one of the leading aggregator and distributors of data from disparate corporate sources. This data is melded into a collective, powerful, interlocking matrix of valuable and concise information. Using DTMI's Market Intelligence Tools, a client-company can compile a comprehensive market report (including total market valuation), pinpoint each unique segment within that market, determine the va! luation and number of companies that make up that segment, then identify actual buyers of its products. Simply put, the value of DTMI to a client-company is this: the comprehensive analysis that DTMI compiles for its clients is usually done in one day or less and costs on average $5000 to $7000. Using a company's own marketing and research department to compile the same information, and generate similiar quality leads, would take weeks or months and cost tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Revised Earnings In today's economic climate of layoffs and cost-cutting, companies are looking for ways to save money. DTMI offers a service they cannot afford to pass up. DTMI management is seeing such a rapid acceleration in the number of companies coming to it for services, it has recently revised earnings projections upward. Also, DTMI is signing up clients with longer-term engagements than management had originally projected. This is just one of the reasons we are strongly recommending this stock. Market Place Sales of Business Information are expected to reach $58 Billion by 2003 according to Verronis Suhler. DTMI's market intelligence segment is expected to reach $4 billion in the next several years. As we stated earlier, DTMI's technology can yield detailed market intelligence in a matter of minutes, compared to weeks or more to cultivate the similar data through traditional means, and at an incredible savings. We believe DTMI's technology is far above its competitors, and that it can capture a huge share of its market. Conclusion We believe market penetration of 1.5-2% is very achievable for DTMI. That could potentially mean an estimated $80 million-plus in revenues per year. Should the company achieve even half those revenues, our target price will be raised significantly. At $40 million in revenues, and with a 30% net margin, earnings would be $12 million. After-tax income would be $0.54 per share. At a 20 P/E ratio the stock would be worth $10.80 per share; but remember, that's half of what we think it could achieve. Also, according to management, based on early feedback from customers, new business will not be a problem. You can see why we are excited about this stock. Additionally, this company just started trading at $1.70 and, based on the company's quick move out of the blocks, Wall Street is paying attention. At these current price levels the stock is difficult for us to ignore. It looks like DTMI is in a strong upward trend, climbing to higher levels.

mary.cook@enron.com,"All, attached is a redline of Master Netting Agreement against the previous Cook c draft and the proposed Collateral Annex. Please review and provide your comments to me by first thing Tuesday morning. Major issues for resolution: 1. We have determined that we should file on cash collateral in Canada. Peter Keohane is reviewing the forms and processes for such, including how to determine and establish priority with respect to same. Peter will coordinate with Credit concerning the mechanics of accomplishing the filings. 2. Due to the continued concern by some counsel in respect of mutuality issues for setoff and netted settlement (another form of setoff) ""aggregate liability clauses"" set forth in 3a and 3b have been included for our consideration. We must come to a consensus as to whether this language/concept should/must be included. If the answer is yes, is the language included the best tactic? 3. Mary Perkins is reviewing LC matters with banks to be sure the modified format set forth in this draft is satisfactory. Timing Objective: Our objective is to provide everyone another draft on Tuesday and finalize on Wednesday. This will require a conference call sometime Monday afternoon. Carol, Rick, David, Peter and Elizabeth please provide Esmeralda Gonzalez, my assistant, at 713 345-7621 with your Monday afternoon availability and she will set a time and advise you.

(Psalms 127:2) Coming into the Promised Land in business will change the way you and I view our work. No longer will we see getting up early and staying up late as God's way. Living in the Promised Land in business means we know that God is the source of our provision and that our work is an act of worship to Him. Provision is a by-product, not an end in itself. Work is no longer something that must be sweated and toiled upon to make ends meet. ""Could this really be true?"" you might be saying. God has made it clear that obedience is the assurance of provision. Whenever we go beyond the normal workday due to fear of non-provision, we are operating in unbelief. We are saying that it is up to us to make things happen. Sure, there are times when we work longer hours due to a deadline, but we must be sure the motive is not out of fear of loss or fear of non-provision. If we are obedient to what God has called us to, He will provide our every need. This can be a hard lesson for goal-oriented businesspeople. I recall coming into this understanding. I had been a workaholic. Long hours were common. Then God shook up my world and I was challenged by a friend to examine my motives for working long hours. I realized the source of those long hours was fear. Once I came into this understanding, I refused to work long hours even though the natural man would tell me I'd never make things happen if I worked a normal work week. Again, this reasoning is based on a lack of faith. If we are obedient to what God has called each of us to, we will not lack. At times it may be less than what we might like; at other times it may be more than we deserve. These are God's ways. The Bible tells us to come out of Babylon. Babylon is a system of work and philosophy that is contrary to God's ways. Are you operating in any aspect of work from a Babylonian value system? Ask the Lord to reveal this to you. Begin to walk in the freedom He has given us in our work life. Published and distributed by Crosswalk.com, this daily devotional is written by Os Hillman (os@marketplaceleaders.org).

Below is your interview schedule for Monday, Oct. 30th and directions to the Enron Bldg.. Please let me know if you need any travel arrangements made. Coming from the northwest part of Houston, your best bet would be to take I-45 into town. There is quite a bit of construction downtown, so you will probably have to take the McKinney exit from I-45 (you will need to stay in the left lane as you approach town. Exit McKinney to Smith Street, take a right on Smith Street go to Andrews Street, take a right on Andrews (the Enron bldg. is on the left), pass the Enron Bldg. cross ""Ruthvan"" (1st stop sign) and pull into the Allen Center Parking garage (Visitors area on your right). Come to the security desk on the 1st floor of the Enron Bldg. and ask for me. They will call me and I will meet you in the elevator lobby on the 19th floor.

wanda.curry@enron.com,"Daily Tie Outs Across Risk Systems Shona, As per my memo to you on August 13th, I am scheduling a kick-off meeting with individuals to discuss a daily tie-out process across all global risk applications/reports, i.e. DPR, Infinity, RisktRAC (VAR and Benchmark) and CAS. This would provide proof (or a trail to what is missing) that required information from all risk books, commodities, and business units are appropriately reported on a daily basis. As stated earlier, without a robust global books application, the daily process currently in place provides little assurance that ""everything"" rolls up correctly. It also does not include Infinity. My suggestion for attendance at this meeting, in addition to you, Beth and I, is as follows: Stacey White Todd Hall Sheila Glover/Clara Carrington Kevin Sweeney Kristin Albrecht Mike Jordan Jeff Gossett Scott Mills Ramesh Ganapathy Debbie Brackett Please let me know today if you agree with this list and I will move forward getting the meeting scheduled and work on a presentation/agenda for you and Beth to approve.
